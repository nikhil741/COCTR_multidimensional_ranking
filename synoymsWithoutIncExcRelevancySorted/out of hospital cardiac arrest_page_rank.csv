We further hypothesize that a combined metric which includes      both the PAR and the individual physiologic components that comprise physiologic tools will      not significantly improve prediction over the PAR alone.

The majority of these deaths takes place outside hospital as sudden cardiac death. However,      with immediate (within minutes) actions such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and      defibrillation many lives would be saved. CPR is a key factor to increase survival from Out      of Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA). CPR buys time by supporting the brain with some      circulation in waiting for a defibrillator that can restart the heart. In Sweden about 2,5      million people are trained in CPR. However, only about half of all OHCA victims will get CPR      in waiting for ambulance arrival.      The aims of the Response to Urgent Mobile message for Bystander Activation (RUMBA) trial is      to try a new way of logistics to increase bystander CPR by recruiting lay volunteers to      nearby OHCAs via their mobile phones.

Therefore the      investigators planned this prospective observational study to determine the epidemiology of      sudden cardiac arrest in the prehospital setting of Tampere area, the quality of the CPR, and      also the associations between depth and frequency of chest compressions and invasive arterial      pressure, EtCO2,cerebral oxygenation and iatrogenic injuries associated to chest compressions      1) in patients resuscitated out of hospital by emergency medical service's (EMS's) personals      and 2) in-hospital by hospital resuscitation team members. In addition, the investigators      will analyze the effects of the chosen method of resuscitation on critical vital signs (Etco2      and invasive pressures): closed-chest CPR is compared to open-chest CPR, or mechanical CPR      with a device (AutoPulse-CPR, Cardio Pump) compared to manual CPR guided with quality CPR      device. The results will give the investigators important insights into the haemodynamics of      CPR which may guide future strategies for the management of cardiac arrest. The research      group is also interested in CPR related injuries and mattress effect.

Furthermore, post-cardiac arrest brain injury is a common cause of morbidity and mortality      after successful resuscitation which is urgent issue to be solved. Therapeutic hypothermia is      part of a standardized treatment strategy for comatose survivors of cardiac arrest in the      metabolic phase usually about 15 minutes after cardiac arrest. However, the evidences of the      efficacy of therapeutic hypothermia are still few. The optimal candidates, temperature, the      timing of initiation, the therapeutic windows and the rate for rewarming have not been      defined clinically and should be established. The purpose of this research is the improvement      in the outcomes for patients with coma after resuscitation from out-of-hospital cardiac      arrest using therapeutic hypothermia established from the analysis of multicenter registry      data.",therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest;,"Cardiovascular Diseases;Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;",C0020674;C0018790;C0034975;C0947630,C0020674;C0018790;C0034975;C0947630,C0007203;C0013778;C0018790;C0018790;C0018790;C0018790;C0035273;C0035273;C1272517;C0270611;C0087111;C0020672;C0020672;C0020672;C0589507;C0220880;C0087111;C0206156;C0442811;C0679199;C0034975;C0018787;C3245511;C0018790;C0009421;C3245479;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0886384;C4684637;C3844714;C2707259;C1547928;C0009421,C0018787,C0524702;C0241868;C0018790;C0013221;C0035273;C4281788;C0041654;C0087111;C0032961;C0013227;C1550655;C1706074;C0150312;C4049938,C0018790;C0020672;C0087111,20110701,,,Completed,22813874,6,6.0,0.017387819970556998,0.020396209215961005,Adult patients who remained unconscious after resuscitation from out-of-hospital or             inhospital cardiac arrest;;;;;;;;;;Presented the stable hemodynamics with drug treatments or mechanical supporting system             including IABP or PCPS,Patients with:;;;;;;;;;;pregnancy;;;;;;;;;;acute aortic dissection;;;;;;;;;;pulmonary thromboembolism;;;;;;;;;;drug poisoning;;;;;;;;;;poor daily activity,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Thus, less than 20 % of patients discharged home with impaired quality of      life associated with symptoms of tiredness, stress, anxiety. The prognosis is related to the      initial cardiac rhythm present during the initiation of resuscitation. Recent progress in the      improvement of mortality and neurological outcome has been achieved over the last decade      thanks to the systematic implementation of a period of targeted temperature control between      32 and 34 ° C in patients who benefited from the realization of at least one electrical      external shock.      There are theoretical and clinical arguments to think that achieving the same way a period of      targeted temperature control between 32 and 34 ° C in patients treated for cardiac arrest      with a non- shockable rhythm on arrival can also benefit from this procedure. However other      arguments are against this hypothesis including an increase in the risk of infection ,      worsening of the patient's hemodynamic status with no benefit to him.

This is important because any early gains achieved during resuscitation will be      nullified if clinicians terminate life-sustaining therapies prematurely based on inadequate      prognostic information. An effective translation strategy for neuroprognostication will      result in improved physician adherence to evidence-based medicine and an increase in the      proportion of patients surviving to achieve a good neurological outcome following cardiac      arrest.,Cardiac arrest;Hypothermia;Post Cardiac Arrest Care;Survivors of cardiac arrest;,Cardiovascular Diseases;,C0018790;C0035273;C1549081;C0151526,C0018790;C0035273;C1549081;C0151526,C0018790;C0018790;C0035273;C0035273;C1549081;C0040712;C0040712;C0679199;C0220901;C0151526;C0376554;C0087111;C1553401;C0087111;C0679199;C0184511;C0018787;C0018790;C0947630;C1550470;C1553407;C0184511;C2707261;C1148554;C3242430;C0487602;C0487602;C0151526;C4084912;C0804815;C0013227;C4698129,C0018790,C0018790;C0005775;C1546399;C1546399;C0009421;C0034107;C1550655;C2004454;C1550655;C2707261;C0237284;C2732140;C3639196;C0886384,C0018790;C0018790;C0018787,20140601,,,Completed,27115286,3,3.0,0.014804838430766,0.018185054419943,Patients =/> 18 years of age;;;;;;;;;;Non-traumatic out of hospital cardiac arrest;;;;;;;;;;Sustained return of spontaneous circulation (palpable pulse for > 20 minutes);;;;;;;;;;Comatose (i.e. without full neurological recovery; non-responsive to verbal commands);;;;;;;;;;Surviving to at least 6 hours after emergency department arrival,Patients who die within 6 hours of emergency department arrival,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Specific objectives are:        1. To conduct iterative semi-structured interviews to identify behavioural factors           influencing identification of cardiac arrest by 9-1-1 call takers;        2. To develop a survey instrument about behavioural factors influencing the ability of           9-1-1 call takers to identify cardiac arrest based on a systematic review of the           literature, the results of the semi-structured interviews, and theoretical constructs           from the Theory of Planned Behaviour; and        3.
