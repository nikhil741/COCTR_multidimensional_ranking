Recent studies have      consistently found that people who do not use caffeine are at higher risk of developing      Parkinson's disease. This suggests that caffeine may have potential as a treatment for PD.      In a pilot study of caffeine for daytime sleepiness in PD, there was evident benefit on the      motor manifestations of disease. There have been other lines of evidence that have suggested      caffeine could be useful in PD. This study is to evaluate the efficacy of caffeine 200 mg BID      vs matching placebo for motor and non-motor aspects of disease. This will be in three stages.      In the first six-month stage, medications will be held constant, to see whether caffeine does      have motor benefits. Then we will perform a four-year extension stage to define if the      effects of caffeine persist (or even magnify), and to see if caffeine helps reduce dose of      other PD meds and/or prevents their side effects. Finally, we will finish with a six-month      stage in which we will place all patients on caffeine - this will allow us to assess      caffeine's use in later disease, but more importantly, will assess whether early use of      caffeine produces long term changes beyond its immediate effects.",,Nervous System Diseases;,C0030567;C0006644;C0087111,C0030567;C0087111;C0006644;C1254351,C0524851;C0030567;C0030567;C0541854;C0877248;C0013227;C0237607;C0231170;C3242385;C0087111;C1697779;C0006644;C0006644;C0006644;C0006644;C0006644;C0006644;C0006644;C0006644;C0006644;C0006644;C0006644;C0947630;C0012634;C0032042;C0012634;C0012634;C3245511;C4684637;C0947630;C0947630;C1561542;C1300072;C1300072;C1561542;C1300072;C1561543;C0042789;C0042789;C0426980;C0040399;C1518681;C1518681;C1525442;C3839460;C3843761;C1300072;C1328018;C1254223;C0220825;C0231617;C0722792;C0029166,C0030567,C0017168;C0451022;C0030920;C0338656;C0004238;C0003811;C0013798;C0003405;C0003405;C4062719;C0004239;C0034394;C0700589;C0242422;C0020538;C0428883;C0039231;C0871470;C0278329;C0025320;C0011570;C0013227;C0013227;C0011900;C0011900;C0001443;C0009079;C0006644;C0006644;C2828392;C0006644;C1547226;C0087111;C0025663;C0023870;C0684240;C0718247;C0205082;C0006104;C1546725;C1300072;C0870077;C3496286;C1114365;C1561538;C1561538;C0031327;C0231221;C0231221;C1552853;C3840775;C4684637;C4684637;C4319952;C4067746;C0804815;C1561542;C1561542;C1706074;C1561542;C1561542;C1561542;C0018792;C3534109;C0381385;C0728774;C0225884,C1140111,20161201,,,Completed,28954882,6,6.0,0.036466232013281,0.033860798533807,PD diagnosis: between 6 months and 8 years;;;;;;;;;;Hoehn and Yahr stage I-III;;;;;;;;;;Age at least 45 and less than 75 (to optimize survival over the 5-year trial).;;;;;;;;;;Receiving symptomatic therapy for PD for at least 6 months.

So far the exact pathophysiology for this is not fully      understood. There are results from pathological analyses that the autonomic nervous system is      also affected by the accumulation of alpha-Synuclein and that this might even happen in very      early stages of the disease process (Qualman et al., 1984; Wakabayashi et al., 1989;      Wakabayashi et al., 1990; Bloch et al., 2006).      Blood pressure dysregulation is a common autonomic symptom in Parkinson`s patients and      treatment - currently most often achieved with Fludrocortisone - often leads to supine      hypertension (Plaschke et al., 1998; Braune et al., 1999; Magerkurth et al., 2005).      There are studies in patients with autonomic failure that indicate that Pyridostigmine      bromide might be an alternative treatment option without causing disabling supine      hypertension (Singer et al., 2003; Sandroni et al., 2005; Singer et al., 2006; Yamamoto et      al., 2006).      Delayed gastric emptying is also an autonomic symptom associated with Parkinson`s disease. By      the elevation of the cholinergic tone with Pyridostigmine bromide the investigators also      expect to alleviate symptoms of delayed gastric emptying and obstipation, possibly even      facilitating the uptake of dopaminergic medication through the gut (Sadjadpour, 1983;      Bharucha et al., 2008).      Therefore the investigators designed a monocentric randomized, controlled, double blind,      crossover phase II trial to show non-inferiority of the effect of pyridostigmine bromide vs.      fludrocortisone on symptoms of autonomic dysregulation in Parkinson`s disease.",,Nervous System Diseases;,C0030567;C2707256;C0277785;C0087111;C1317000,C0034262;C0016280;C2911690;C1457887;C0012634;C0456909;C1836729;C3897779,C0152020;C0152020;C0034262;C0392678;C0030567;C0030567;C0393911;C0683525;C0277785;C0016280;C0016280;C0005823;C0005823;C0034261;C0034261;C0020538;C0020538;C0221152;C0013227;C0012238;C0087111;C0439775;C0027769;C0012634;C1457887;C0947630;C1457887;C3245511;C3245511;C0243144;C1518681;C0439095;C0456909;C0699819;C1836729;C0242893;C1457887;C1457887;C1457887;C4055506;C0282151;C0162340;C2911690;C1300072;C1328018;C1328018;C0018792;C0450955;C0332149,C0030567,C0020651;C0009450;C0011849;C0442893;C0085762;C0221102;C0221102;C0013227;C0013227;C0087111;C0678835;C0460139;C0262512;C0012634;C0543467;C0262512;C0005767;C0013227;C0013227;C0013227;C0003364;C0231221;C2707256;C1457887;C0562357;C1156284,C1140111,20160101,,,Unknown status,28224720,1,1.0,0.029042034953938,0.028449017163892,"informed, written & formal consent for participation;;;;;;;;;;male / female subjects, aged 50-80 years;;;;;;;;;;PD patients (18 subjects with symptomatic orthostatic hypotension)",medication influencing gastrointestinal motility for at least the elimination half             life of the drug;;;;;;;;;;medication interfering with blood-pressure regulation for at least the elimination             half life of the drug;;;;;;;;;;significant systemic illness;;;;;;;;;;BMI <18 or >30kg/m2;;;;;;;;;;symptoms or a history of GI disease or surgery;;;;;;;;;;with any evidence of infectious disease;;;;;;;;;;evidence or history of drug or alcohol abuse;;;;;;;;;;diabetes mellitus,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Patients in the trial will have been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and will be failing      on current treatment with L-DOPA but they will not have progressed to drug-induced      dyskinesias. The first stage is an open-label dose escalation to evaluate up to three dose      levels of ProSavin in cohorts of three patients each. Following a recommendation by the DMC      the study may proceed to the second stage of the trial, a further 12 patients will be      recruited to confirm efficacy of the optimal dose in the randomized phase of the study.      The efficacy of ProSavin will be assessed using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Score      (UPDRS). Patients will be monitored at regular intervals, with the primary endpoint being an      efficacy assessment at six months after treatment.

Droxidopa is being studied to determine the effects on blood pressure changes upon      standing up (orthostatic challenge). Symptoms and activity measurements, including patient      reported falls, will be evaluated to determine the effectiveness of the study drug.      Symptoms of NOH may include any of the following:        -  Dizziness, light-headedness, feeling faint or feeling like you may blackout        -  Problems with vision (blurring, seeing spots, tunnel vision, etc.)        -  Weakness        -  Fatigue        -  Trouble concentrating        -  Head & neck discomfort (the coat hanger syndrome)        -  Difficulty standing for a short time or a long time        -  Trouble walking for a short time or a long time      The study duration is a maximum of approximately 14 weeks including up to 2 weeks for      screening, up to 2 weeks for proper dose finding, followed by an 8 week treatment period and      a follow-up visit after 2 weeks.

Laboratory work has shown strong, reproducible evidence that this drug has beneficial      ""disease modifying"" effects when given to animals with a range of experimental models of      Parkinson's disease (PD). This project aims to make an initial evaluation of possible      benefits of Exenatide among patients with moderate symptoms of PD. The drug will be given as      a twice daily 10microgram injection under the skin in a similar way to one of the      conventional ""symptomatic"" treatments for PD (Apomorphine).      Forty patients with moderate symptoms of PD will be recruited and randomised to receive      Exenatide injections twice daily, or to act as controls in this open label trial. Detailed      assessments will be made of all patients at baseline and periodically for a total of 14      months. The primary outcome measure will be the change between baseline and follow up, in the      severity of a validated PD assessment scale (the UPDRS part 3 motor score) after an overnight      period free of conventional PD medication. Secondary measures will include adverse event      reports, self completed questionnaires, and blood test results. Aside from these assessments,      all patients will continue their regular PD medications throughout the trial with adjustments      made only according to clinical need.      In a subgroup of patients (n=10), brain scans that assess the severity of PD, will be      performed at both baseline and follow up to help understand possible mechanisms of action of      Exenatide.",Parkinson's Disease;PD;Moderate Parkinson's Disease;,Nervous System Diseases;,C0030567;C0167117;C0087111;C0947630,C0030567;C2911690;C0167117;C0167117;C0087111;C1547226;C1549113;C1522485;C1515974;C1550655,C0086272;C0030567;C0849535;C0011849;C0450973;C0034394;C0877248;C0003596;C1261322;C1261322;C0013227;C2945673;C0596217;C0022885;C0220825;C0087111;C0021485;C0013227;C0162340;C0167117;C0087111;C0167117;C0021485;C0167117;C0167117;C0332149;C0332149;C0012634;C3540698;C0684224;C0025344;C3244317;C3244317;C1705425;C0013227;C0013227;C1551994;C1552861;C0231221;C1457887;C1457887;C0031082;C1518681;C2945733;C0031327;C0027627;C1561542;C2702329;C0018792;C3534109;C0018792;C3242613;C1548573;C1547226;C1547226;C0728774;C0728774;C3272565;C0728774,C0030567,C0017178;C0037019;C0022661;C1565489;C0451074;C0549433;C0027051;C0020179;C0373595;C0030567;C0002395;C4684571;C0030567;C0030567;C0543467;C0588008;C0040615;C0870227;C0011849;C0011849;C0745343;C0178601;C0019202;C0242896;C0018799;C1533734;C0006147;C0700589;C0203860;C0152020;C0038766;C0020699;C0029936;C0242422;C0242422;C0242422;C0242422;C0178793;C0017296;C0030305;C1290940;C0002453;C0002453;C0003596;C0277785;C0025320;C0002403;C0013227;C0013227;C0013227;C0013227;C0013227;C2945640;C0040732;C0001973;C0011900;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0805586;C0011900;C0242114;C0012634;C0087111;C0442711;C0442711;C0011265;C0205082;C0549206;C0441767;C0009653;C0012634;C0012634;C1550655;C0262926;C1704788;C0600109;C0012634;C0543467;C0262926;C0018787;C0543467;C0262926;C0262926;C0025344;C0023570;C0023570;C0087136;C0023570;C1547311;C0023570;C0023570;C0725694;C0332148;C0018270;C4085651;C4085652;C0205082;C0002962;C0205082;C0522224;C0013227;C4318566;C0013227;C1114365;C1849728;C0001645;C4699604;C0241526;C1457887;C1457887;C0233730;C4699613;C0009797;C2707261;C1704258;C4684637;C4684637;C4684637;C3842337;C0543467;C1321866;C3714738;C3844714;C4086543;C0332534;C0332534;C0332534;C1561542;C1512346;C1561542;C0018792;C3534109;C3534109;C0018792;C0018792;C3534109;C3534109;C4331837;C0018792;C0018792;C2366367;C1547226;C0005847;C0274281;C0069695,C0030567;C0242422,20130301,,,Unknown status,23728174,71,71.0,0.03235489102943,0.032695864154181,"Diagnosis of Idiopathic Parkinson's disease of moderate severity- equivalent to Hoehn/             Yahr stage 2 to 2.5 (Bilateral symptoms but still physically independent).
