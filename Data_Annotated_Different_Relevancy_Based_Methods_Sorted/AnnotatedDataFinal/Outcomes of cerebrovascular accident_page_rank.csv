Time of stroke onset is defined at the time at which the             patient/relative is first aware of the stroke deficit. For patients who awake with             deficits, or who are found unconscious, the time of onset is defined as the time at             which they were last known to be symptom free.          -  Have a stroke that is radiologically confirmed to be ischemic and supratentorial. The             diameter of the ischemic lesion is >15mm in any single direction or the volume is             >4cc. See the Study Procedures Manual (SPM) for guidance on how to calculate the             lesion size.          -  Have a total NIHSS score of 3-21.          -  Have a lower limb deficit from the incident stroke which is defined as a score of 1-4             on the NIHSS Motor Leg question (question #6).          -  Aged 18-90, inclusive.          -  Expectation the subject will receive standard physical, occupational and speech             rehabilitation therapy as indicated for the post stroke deficits.          -  Male subjects and female subjects of non-child-bearing and child-bearing potential are             allowed to participate in this study. See Section 11, Appendix 1 for definitions.             Females of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to             enrollment and must agree to use one of the contraceptive methods specified in Section             11, Appendix 1.        Exclusion Criteria:          -  Ability to walk >0.8m/s as measured by the Gait Velocity assessment.          -  History of a previous symptomatic stroke within 3 months prior to study entry.          -  Presence of significant disability prior to the current stroke. Significant disability             is defined as having a pre-stroke Rankin score of >2.          -  Subjects who are not alert or are unresponsive as defined by a score of 2 or 3 on the             NIHSS Level of Consciousness question (Question 1a).          -  Presence of significant aphasia likely to confound or interfere with completion of the             study assessments.          -  Presence of a significant pre-existing gait deficit prior to study entry that is             likely to confound clinical evaluations          -  Presence of pre-existing neurologic or psychiatric disease which is active and not             adequately controlled such that it interfered with major activities of daily living             immediately prior to the current stroke and is likely to interfere with study             participation/visits or confound clinical evaluations.          -  The subject poses a significant suicide risk, in the opinion of the investigator.          -  Current or chronic history of liver disease, known hepatic or biliary abnormalities             (except Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones), or known history of hepatitis             B or hepatitis C infection. A positive hepatitis B or hepatitis C result on the GSK             labs drawn at baseline/Study Day 1 do not exclude a subject from continuing in the             study unless there are associated clinical signs/symptoms of liver disease; however,             the subject should be treated as clinically indicated and the GSK Medical Monitor             should be contacted for further discussion.          -  Presence of either a central or peripheral demyelinating disease, such as multiple             sclerosis or IgM monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS).          -  Expected death due to the incident stroke, or evidence of a chronic co-morbid             condition or unstable acute systemic illness which, in the opinion of the             investigator, could shorten the subject's survival such that it would limit his/her             ability to complete the study.          -  Presence of the following ECG values on baseline ECG: QTc > 500 msec (using either             Bazett's formula (QTcB) or Fridericia's formula (QTcF)); or uncorrected QT >600msec             (machine or manual over-read). If the ECG indicates a prolonged QTc interval value             outside these limits, two further ECGs should be performed during the same sitting and             the average QTc value of these triplicate ECGs calculated. If the average value             exceeds the stated limits, the subject is not eligible.          -  Participation in any investigational rehabilitation paradigm targeting stroke recovery             during the duration of this study.          -  Have a contraindication to MRI as per local hospital practice/guidelines.          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the             investigational product (whichever is longer).          -  Prior treatment with GSK249320.          -  History of sensitivity to Investigational Product excipients (acetate buffer,             polysorbate 80 and sodium chloride) that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK             Medical Monitor, contraindicates the subject's participation.          -  Pregnant females as determined by positive urine hCG test prior to enrollment.          -  Lactating females.          -  Subjects considered unwilling or unable to comply with the procedures and study ﻿visit             schedule outlined in the protocol.","Study MAG104615, a Proof of Concept Study for GSK249320 versus placebo in Stroke Patients.",Ischemic Stroke;,Nervous System Diseases;Cardiovascular Diseases;,C1705250;C0038454;C1550655,C1705250;C0032042;C0038454;C0947630;C0947630;C1550655,C1705250;C0032042;C0038454;C0947630;C0947630;C1550655,C0038454,C0427780;C0034991;C0234425;C0700589;C0011303;C0026470;C0017551;C0442893;C1301624;C3245491;C3245491;C3245491;C0037494;C0034991;C1096775;C0032601;C0023895;C0023895;C1552679;C1552679;C0237284;C0563664;C0231221;C0489625;C1555471;C0041654;C1261322;C0220825;C0220825;C0019196;C0019163;C0019196;C1704788;C0558058;C0184661;C0023216;C1516879;C0031809;C0231170;C0231170;C0008350;C0557061;C0162791;C1516879;C0750484;C0011900;C0750484;C0019158;C0009450;C0036429;C0012634;C0087111;C2828358;C0005847;C0006104;C0031843;C0031843;C0574032;C0150600;C2828392;C0003617;C0003617;C0150312;C1522634;C0150312;C0150312;C0150312;C1446409;C0150312;C1517001;C0443343;C0150312;C0237607;C0549206;C1446409;C0086960;C0442711;C1457887;C0700320;C0700320;C0262926;C0003537;C0012634;C0262512;C0205054;C0262512;C1552867;C0199168;C0181904;C1556133;C0441636;C0277814;C0262926;C0000975;C0199168;C0181904;C0038454;C1550512;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0221198;C0087136;C0024763;C0221198;C0038454;C0037817;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0332148;C0332148;C0038454;C0332148;C0038454;C0024763;C0038454;C0025344;C1518681;C0006353;C0566415;C0725694;C0234422;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0239110;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0011065;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0595998;C0042036;C0947630;C0016928;C0016928;C0026470;C0392366;C0023216;C1561538;C1141639;C0231221;C0684336;C1704788;C0184661;C3245491;C3245491;C1457887;C2004454;C4269149;C0237677;C1838994;C1548428;C4082977;C4684637;C4684637;C4684637;C4684637;C4684637;C3842337;C1328956;C1328956;C0699794;C1320102;C0451227;C3809765;C1697779;C2911690;C1548762;C4048188;C0560046;C0332534;C0332534;C1561542;C1512346;C1512346;C3534109;C4331837;C4331837;C4331837;C3534109;C3534109;C4331837;C4331837;C4331837;C4331837;C1444657;C1553756;C0010201;C1441792;C3245509;C0600109;C3172260;C0022116;C0022116;C1522634;C1522634;C0031809;C1522634;C3272565;C3272565;C0728774;C3272565;C4283785;C0728774;C4086490;C1172837;C0332155;C0016590;C0016590;C1172837;C0151872,C0948008,20140728,203.0,5453.0,Terminated,28228578,4,4.0,0.0037758172585990006,0.006005891569359999

Several clinical trials with stroke patients have      produced statistically significant gains in upper limb function when using instrumental      playing and treatments where rhythm supports the priming and timing of movements. Based on      the positive results from controlled and non-controlled trials, the Cochrane review of music      therapy for acquired brain injury (Bradt, et al., 2010) recommends further investigation into      rhythm based techniques to treat hemiparesis in stroke patients, and that future studies need      to examine the relationship between the frequency and duration of interventions and treatment      effects.      The aim of this study is to examine whether or not a thirty minute, twice weekly, six week,      home music therapy treatment, playing set musical patterns on instruments to music is      feasible to deliver, and will lead to improved coordination, dexterity and activities of      daily living in hemiparetic stroke patients.      Twelve patients will be recruited from Cambridgeshire Community Services NHS trust (CCS) who      are between one month and two years post stroke with hemiparesis. Participants will have      completed and been discharged from community rehabilitation for their upper limb and not be      receiving any other treatment for arm function. They will be randomised into two groups:      treatment (for immediate treatment following discharge from community rehab) and waiting list      (beginning 9 weeks after baseline measure). Participants will be assessed at the beginning      and end of treatment (just before starting and just after completing 6 weeks of treatment) by      one of two experienced community occupational therapists under contract with CCS, who are      also experienced in working with stroke patients and who will be blind to the experiment. The      other three measures will be conducted by the chief investigator. The assessment tools will      be the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) and nine hole peg test (9HPT).

After the initial recovery phase, only limited gains are achieved by retraining the      weak limb to perform daily tasks. However, new treatment strategies such as repetitive      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) show promise for enhancing motor recovery after      stroke. rTMS is a noninvasive technique for modifying brain activity that aims to improve      motor function by correcting abnormal patterns that occur after stroke. We believe that      giving rTMS right before a therapy session will prepare the brain so that the patient is      better able to participate in and benefit from training of the hand and arm. The goal of this      study is to test how well this new strategy works to improve recovery in people who have mild      to moderate weakness of the arm and hand after stroke.      Participants will receive magnetic stimulation of the movement area of the brain just prior      to arm and hand training for a series of eight sessions. We will evaluate changes in hand and      arm function after the intervention and one month later to see if the changes are maintained.      We will also test whether some groups of people benefit more than others from the      intervention. If improvements in hand and arm function are observed after the intervention,      we will test it more rigourously in a future clinical trial in which participants are      randomly assigned to different treatment conditions.

Aphasia is not an exclusion             criterion, but the patients should understand simple spoken orders.","Background and purpose:      About 30% of people with stroke suffered from severe long-term upper extremity （UE） motor      impairment. Severe UE impairment, especially dysfunction of hand, can greatly impact stroke      patients' daily living independence and quality of life. However, treatment effect of current      interventions is still limited. Nick Ward and Leonardo Cohen suggested 5 intervention      strategies for stroke motor recovery: （1） reduction of somatosensory input from the intact;      （2） increase in somatosensory input from the paretic; （3） anesthesia of a body part proximal      to the paretic hand; （4） activity within the affected motor cortex may be up-regulated; （5）      activity within the intact motor cortex may be down-regulated. Recent studies have shown each      strategy to be effective in stroke patients with mild or moderate UE impairment. However,      evidence for people with severe UE impairment after stroke remains unclear. Since research      has found a greater effect for combined strategies than a single strategy, this proposal      develops a combined intervention with the above 5 strategies, named ""transcranial direct      current stimulation （tDCS） combined sensory modulation intervention"". This intervention is      expected to be most effective for people with severe UE impairment after stroke.      In addition, neuroimaging can provide in vivo information about the brain plasticity which      underpinning the motor recovery after stroke. However, image indexes that can be used in      stroke patients with severe UE impairment remained examined. Therefore, this proposal has 3      aims: （1） to examine the treatment effect of the ""tDCS combined sensory modulation      intervention"" in stroke patients with severe UE impairment; （2） to examine the underline      mechanism of the efficacy of ""tDCS combined sensory modulation intervention"" using      neuroimaging technology.      Methods:      This study is a double-blinded randomized controlled trial which will recruit 60 people who      have had stroke onset more than 6 months and have severe UE motor impairment. All      participants will be randomly assigned into 2 groups. The experimental group will be given      the ""tDCS combined sensory modulation intervention"", combining bilateral tDCS stimulation,      anesthesia techniques and repetitive passive motor training. The control group is given sham      tDCS, sham anesthesia and repetitive passive motor training. Each group will be evaluated for      outcomes at 4 time points （i.e. baseline, post-intervention, 3 months and 6months      post-intervention）. The immediate and long-term effect of the interventions will be examined.      Primary outcome indicators include upper extremity impairment measures. Secondary outcome      measures include upper extremity function, activities of daily living function, functional      Magnetic Resonance Imaging （fMRI）, and corticospinal tract structural integrity using      diffusion spectrum imaging （DSI）. Fifteen subjects of each group will be assessed 2 times      （i.e., prior to the intervention and after the intervention） for fMRI and DSI scan.      Anticipatory results and contributions:      The results of the studies are expected to present a potentially effective intervention for      stroke patients with severe impaired UE motor. Imaging evidence of brain plasticity for this      particular intervention is also provided. The results will contribute to our understanding of      brain plasticity for UE motor recovery after stroke. Findings from this proposal may help      researchers and clinicians choose or develop interventions that are optimal to their clients      individually.",recovery of function;stroke;Upper extremity;Motor;transcranial direct current stimulation;,Nervous System Diseases;Cardiovascular Diseases;,C3850024;C0184661;C1547296;C0038454;C1550655;C0183210,C3850024;C1140618;C0034991;C0184661;C1547296;C0038454;C1550655;C0183210;C1705273,C0282440;C0024485;C0936236;C1518681;C1518681;C1140618;C0518214;C1140618;C1140618;C0886296;C0886296;C0162340;C0886296;C0184661;C0026607;C0026607;C0184661;C0184661;C0184661;C0679575;C0184661;C0184661;C0679575;C0184661;C0184661;C0184661;C0184661;C0184661;C0184661;C0184661;C0277785;C1292856;C1292856;C0684336;C0684336;C0679199;C0002903;C0684336;C0684336;C0679199;C0679199;C0684336;C0684336;C0684336;C0684336;C0002903;C0002903;C0021212;C0684336;C4551656;C0229962;C1697779;C0683278;C0679199;C0679199;C1948033;C0332128;C1948033;C1552601;C0332128;C0031843;C0031843;C2926606;C1948033;C0947630;C0918012;C0025663;C0079595;C4035627;C0947630;C0150312;C0011923;C0038454;C0205082;C0205082;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0205082;C0038454;C1518681;C0087136;C3244286;C0205082;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0205082;C0038454;C0205082;C0038454;C0205082;C1552839;C1518681;C0038454;C0205082;C0038454;C0027365;C0006104;C1696103;C0947630;C3244317;C3244317;C0006104;C0006104;C0018563;C0018563;C3850024;C1273517;C3850024;C3850024;C3850024;C3850024;C3850024;C0376335;C0376335;C0441633;C1552861;C0439857;C1550470;C0442694;C0442694;C2004454;C2004454;C2004454;C1555587;C0000589;C0000589;C3242430;C0183210;C0183210;C0183210;C0183210;C0451227;C1831583;C1831583;C1831583;C0031843;C0220825;C0027627;C4055646;C4055646;C1561542;C1561542;C1552839;C1552839;C1552839;C1552839;C4331837;C4489236;C4049938;C4049938;C1547226;C0728774;C1555587;C3834249;C2363670,C0038454,C0007680;C0024485;C0003195;C0040405;C0553692;C0011615;C0025637;C0277814;C0031119;C1140618;C1140618;C1140618;C0262926;C0241889;C0037274;C0009791;C0180307;C0200116;C0947647;C0161479;C0278140;C0018991;C0031809;C0026838;C0002903;C0003862;C0162340;C0002598;C0002932;C0003811;C0162340;C0876929;C0003864;C0036557;C2698969;C0030163;C0012634;C0014544;C0020517;C0021102;C0003537;C0038454;C0205082;C0016129;C3244315;C0205082;C0010957;C0018792;C0683278;C3244315;C0013769;C0175659;C0043262;C0036270;C0018670;C0027530;C1136201;C0442694;C0723323;C0723323;C1550043;C0013227;C1561542;C0722436;C0882217;C0022116,C1292856;C3244286;C2004454,20150601,,,Completed,28652065,0,0.0,0.003096643998252,0.004250855948774
NCT01366729,1,Gait Rehabilitation Post Stroke:the Long Term Effect of Two Walking Aids -Canes and TheraTogs,"How to Improve Walking, Balance and Social Participation Following Stroke: a Comparison of Cane Walking to an Orthosis TheraTogs in Early Post-stroke Gait Rehabilitation. A Multi-centred, Single Blind,Randomized Control Trial.",Stroke;,Inclusion Criteria:          -  patients with hemiplegia following a first unilateral stroke          -  will score at least level 3 on the Functional Ambulation Category (FAC) (able to walk             unaided on even ground but requiring verbal prompts and stand-by help without body             contact)          -  must have been independent walkers prior to insult without walking aids          -  Subjects will have a Mini Mental State score of 22 or above        Exclusion Criteria:          -  orthopaedic or other neurological conditions that could limit walking ability          -  no gross visuospatial or visual field deficits          -  no medical contraindications to walking,"Background 9000 people a year in Switzerland suffer a first time stroke. Of these 20 to 30%      remain unable to walk and up to 60% are left with moderate to severe walking disability.      Evidence shows that rehabilitation techniques which emphasise use of the hemiplegic side      influence ipsilesional cortical plasticity and improve functional outcomes. Canes are      commonly used in gait rehabilitation although they significantly reduce hemiplegic muscle      activity. We have shown that an orthosis ""TheraTogs"" ( elastic corset supporting hemiplegic      side) significantly increases hemiplegic muscle activity during gait.      To date no clinical studies have investigated the long term effects of these techniques on      gait recovery following stroke.      This study aims to determine if advances in the understanding of cortical plasticity and its      relation to functional recovery following stroke can be applied to clinical gait      rehabilitation to improve long term outcomes.      Hypotheses Early gait rehabilitation with canes will reduce hemiplegic muscle activity and      inhibit balance reactions. In the long term this causes poorer walking ability and balance      and consequently reduced social participation.      Early gait rehabilitation with TheraTogs will increase hemiplegic muscle activity and      facilitate balance reactions. In the long term this improves walking ability and balance      leading to increased social independence and participation.      Design Multi-centred, single blind, randomized control trial. Subjects 120 first time stroke      patients Intervention When subjects can walk unaided on even ground whilst requiring verbal      prompts and stand-by help without body contact (FAC 3) they will be randomly allocated into      intervention (TheraTogs) or control (cane) group. TheraTogs will be applied to support hip      extensor and abductor musculature according to a standardized procedure. Cane walking with      cane at the level of the radial styloid of the sound wrist. Subjects will walk throughout the      day with the assigned walking aid. Standard therapy treatments and usual care will remain      unchanged and documented.The intervention will continue for five weeks or until patients have      reached FAC 5 (independent walkers on all surfaces).      Measures: the day before intervention begin, the day after intervention completion (max 5      weeks), 3 months, 6 months and 2 years after completion Primary outcome Timed ""up and go""      test Secondary outcomes surface EMG of hemiplegic lower extremity musculature,      temporo-spatial gait parameters, hip kinematics, dynamic balance. The Stroke Impact Scale.      Results Significance levels will be 5% with 95% CI`s. ITT analyses will be performed.      Descriptive statistics will be presented. Relevant co-variables will be identified and      analysed.

Background: Although aggressive antithrombotic therapy has been shown to reduce the number of      new ischemic events following stroke/TIA, this has always been offset by an increase in the      risk of hemorrhagic transformation. Dabigatran is much safer than previously tested      antithrombotic agents, with respect to intracranial bleeding and therefore offers a unique      treatment opportunity in these high-risk patients. TIA/minor stroke represent the largest      group of cerebrovascular disease patients. A short-term intervention such as 30 days of      dabigatran treatment has the potential for a very large impact from the population health      perspective, given the number of patients who may be treated if a benefit can be      demonstrated.      Study design:      This is an open label, single arm study. Patients with TIA/minor stroke (National Institutes      of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score </=3) who can be treated within 24 hours of symptom      onset will be eligible. All patients will be treated with dabigatran for 30 days. The dose of      dabigatran will be determined by age and renal function (patients >80 years old and/or with      GFR 30-50 ml/min will received 110 mg bid, and all other patients will receive 150 mg      BID).The primary endpoint is symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation. Patients (n=50) with      TIA/minor stroke, defined as having a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale Score of      </=3, will undergo an MRI, including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), as well as gradient      recall echo (GRE) sequences, which will be used to assess for hemorrhagic transformation.      Patients will have a repeat MRI examination at 7 and 30 days to assess for hemorrhagic      transformation and new lesion development. The primary endpoint of of phase I is symptomatic      hemorrhagic transformation, defined as a parenchymal hematoma on the day 7 MRI scan (GRE      sequence), associated with clinical worsening (>/=4 point increase in National Institutes of      Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score).      If dabigatran can be used safely in this population, a second phase aimed at demonstrating      the rate of new ischemic lesion development following TIA can be reduced with aggressive      antithrombotic therapy. A randomized open-label, blinded endpoint evaluation design will be      employed. The investigators hypothesize that dabigatran therapy administered within 24 hours      of symptom onset will reduce the rate of new ischemic lesions, relative to standard care, one      week and 30 days after onset.",,"Nervous System Diseases;Cardiovascular Diseases;Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;",C0007787;C2348066;C0087111;C0038454,C0007787;C2348066;C0087111;C0038454,C0007820;C1704311;C0151699;C3242284;C2986535;C2986535;C1510411;C1510411;C1510411;C1510411;C1510411;C0184661;C4049715;C0031809;C0243107;C0243107;C2348066;C2348066;C2348066;C0450093;C2348066;C2348066;C2348066;C0220825;C2348066;C0018017;C0087111;C0087111;C0031843;C1305866;C0018944;C0024485;C3853789;C0557351;C2828392;C0087111;C1457887;C0079595;C0087111;C0087111;C1457887;C0221198;C0038454;C0038454;C0392366;C0038454;C0087136;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0034770;C0221198;C0038454;C0221198;C3244317;C0947630;C1705425;C0947630;C0175659;C0022646;C0175659;C1705425;C1273517;C1273517;C1561540;C1578513;C0446516;C0017654;C0598801;C1578513;C1561538;C1578513;C1578513;C0231221;C0231221;C0933845;C2360800;C3853789;C1550655;C1550655;C1550655;C4082977;C3842337;C3842337;C4684637;C3842337;C4684637;C3842337;C1328956;C1328956;C1328956;C1547300;C1547300;C1552839;C3534109;C3534109;C4697740;C0150312;C0022116;C4086490;C3272565;C0022116;C0022116;C3172260;C0332155;C0332155;C0332155;C0019080;C0019080;C0019080;C0019080;C0019080,C1550450,C0017654;C0411282;C0007766;C0014099;C0149871;C0151699;C0004238;C0034065;C0948008;C0003281;C0009924;C0007272;C0018826;C0035078;C0520997;C0520997;C0016911;C2348066;C1550470;C0677042;C0022116;C0036572;C0149931;C0021102;C0019080;C1457887;C0087111;C0027651;C0000833;C0262512;C0221423;C0038454;C0221198;C0038454;C0393040;C0038454;C0947630;C0947630;C0918012;C0038257;C1709157;C0598801;C0017654;C1114365;C1301624;C0398623;C1550655;C1550655;C1552867;C1550655;C1552867;C1550655;C1550655;C1552867;C1550655;C1550655;C1552867;C0237677;C4684637;C4684637;C3842337;C3842337;C4055646;C3534109;C1555709;C4331837;C0332155,C1140111,20140501,,,Completed,26304866,2,2.0,0.00297356728129,0.004181049991258

The primary objective of this study is to determine whether CPAP adherence in stroke patients      with obstructive sleep apnea can be improved by a CPAP training strategy during      rehabilitation combined with a telemedicine monitoring system after discharge.      The secondary objective is to compare recording quality as well as subjective and objective      sleep data of non-attended level III polygraphy, polysomnography and telemetric CPAP data in      the management of sleep apnea in stroke.      Further the investigators aim to study changes in nocturnal systolic blood pressure due to      CPAP therapy with the pulse transit time method.      Finally, the investigators intend to study the relationship between CPAP compliance, sleep      and medical and neurorehabilition outcome parameters.      Design:      Single-blind, mono-center, randomized controlled trial on standard CPAP treatment as compared      with CPAP treatment with a telemedicine monitoring system in stroke patients with moderate to      severe OSA.      Setting: Neurorehabilitation center in Vienna, Austria      Patients: Adult subacute (1 to 12 months post stroke) stroke patients 18-70 yrs of age) with      moderate to severe OSA (apnea hypopnea index (AHI) ≥ 15/hr) determined by non-attended      polysomnography (AHI) ≥ 15/hr of sleep) or level III polygraphy (AHI) ≥ 30/hr of      out-of-center sleep testing (OCST), who undergo successful CPAP training and titration (goal      AHI< 10) at the neurorehabilitation unit.      Interventions: Patients will be randomized to either standard care with an autotitrating CPAP      device or an autotitrating CPAP device that transmits physiologic information (i.e.,      adherence, air leak, residual AHI) daily to a website that will be reviewed by their homecare      provider. If any problems are identified, the patient will be contacted by his homecare      provider by telephone. Neurologists performing sleep and neurological scoring will be blinded      to the randomization.      Measurements: Recording of the different measuring systems, subjective and objective sleep      quality, CPAP adherence after 3 months and 1 year in hours used per night, systolic BP      determined by means of a non-linear algorithm and an individual one-point calibration of the      pulse transit time obtained with a cuff-based BP measuring system (SOMNOmedics GmbH, Germany)      and neurorehabilitation outcome parameters as Barthel Index, Timed Up and Go Test.",obstructive sleep apnea;CPAP;stroke;telemedicine;neurorehabilitation;systolic blood pressure;,"Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;Nervous System Diseases;Cardiovascular Diseases;Respiratory Tract Diseases;",C0162648;C0037315;C0150369;C0038454,C0162648;C0037315;C0150369;C0011900;C0087111;C0038454;C0392347;C1548341,C0282440;C0520679;C0871470;C0204096;C1139730;C1139730;C0162701;C0162701;C0034991;C0162701;C1273869;C0451019;C0162648;C0162648;C0037315;C0037315;C0597266;C0376636;C0597266;C0018017;C0012621;C0027627;C0018017;C0018017;C0087111;C0087111;C0162621;C0018017;C0002045;C0184511;C0679199;C2828392;C0235546;C2828392;C0282443;C1555587;C1555587;C0087111;C0087111;C4281677;C2349146;C0684224;C0205082;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0025663;C1549113;C0038454;C0205082;C0038454;C0038454;C0205082;C0947630;C0947630;C0037313;C0947630;C0034107;C0947630;C0037313;C0456909;C0003578;C0918012;C0037313;C0037313;C0037313;C0034107;C3245479;C3245479;C0018017;C1561543;C1273517;C0022885;C0204096;C0204096;C0018017;C4699604;C0442694;C0442694;C1550655;C1550655;C0033213;C3842480;C2707261;C3242430;C4082977;C4082977;C2979880;C3714738;C1550043;C2979880;C3843236;C1515258;C1561542;C0729829;C3245509;C1547226;C1547226;C1547226;C1995642;C0031843;C4698129;C4082977;C4698129;C4698129;C4698129,C0039082;C0003578,C0024117;C0520680;C0541854;C0022658;C0424574;C0037315;C0031809;C0037315;C0027404;C0011900;C0011900;C0012634;C0011265;C0700287;C0442711;C0087111;C0087111;C0038454;C0006826;C0205082;C0566415;C0725694;C0009421;C0018026;C1551994;C4699604;C1550655;C1550655;C1548428;C2328206;C0600109,C0005823;C0037313,20180801,,,Completed,30176970;29317418,2,1.0,0.002713608615587,0.003934773029699

For tDCS, two      small metal disks (electrodes) attached to wires are placed on small cotton pads and taped to      the subject's head, one on the forehead above the eye and the other on the top of the head.      The electrodes deliver a brief electrical current that stimulates the cortex, the part of the      brain responsible for motor function.      Adult patients who have weakness on one side of their body as a result of a stroke occurred      within the last 15 days may be eligible for this study. NIH is not directly recruiting      patients for this study. Patients will be selected through the National Rehabilitation      Hospital (NRH) Research Center personnel in Washington, DC, from patients under treatment at      that facilitiy. Candidates are screened with a physical and neurologic examination, a review      of tests done on admission to NRH, and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, if one has      not been done since the stroke. MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to obtain      images of the brain. The MRI scanner is a metal cylinder surrounded by a strong magnetic      field. During the MRI, the patient lies on a table that can slide in and out of the cylinder.      Scanning time for this study takes about 30 to 45 minutes.      Participants are randomly assigned to receive tDCS or placebo stimulation, along with      rehabilitation therapy, for 2 to 3 weeks, depending on the patient's length of stay at the      NRH. For the placebo stimulation, electrodes are placed on the patient's scalp as with tDCS,      but no current is delivered. Before and after each rehabilitation session with electrodes,      patients undergo Jebsen Taylor motor testing, in which they are asked to lift small objects,      turn cards, use a spoon, stack checkers, and lift cans as fast as they can.      On the day of discharge, patients have physical and neurological examinations and the motor      function tests described below. The motor tests are repeated, along with standard care and a      review of their health status, during outpatient follow-up visits scheduled at 3, and 12      months. The motor tests are:        -  Wolf motor function test - Patients are asked to raise a forearm on a table, on a box,           to reach across a table, push a sandbag, place a hand on the table, pull a weight, lift           a can, pick up a pencil, pick up a paper clip, stack checkers, flip cards, use a key,           fold a towel, and pick up a basket.        -  Barthel index - Patients are timed for the speed with which they perform certain tasks,           such as feeding, grooming, or moving a wheelchair.        -  Abilhand questionnaire - Patients answer questions about how they perform routine daily           activities.        -  GOT test of tactile discrimination - Patients describe objects they feel with their           hand.        -  Ashworth spasticity scale - A medical staff person moves the patient's arm back and           forth to see how stiff it is.",Direct Current Stimulation;Cortical Reorganization;Rehabilitation;Acute Stroke;Stroke;,Nervous System Diseases;Cardiovascular Diseases;,C0013786;C2004454;C0038454;C0006104,C3850024;C2985765;C0087111;C2004454;C0038454;C3850024;C0034991;C1705273;C0429964,C0024485;C0027853;C0034991;C0034991;C0027853;C0034991;C0870227;C0508431;C0230003;C0034991;C0034991;C0012632;C0430740;C0034394;C1292856;C1273518;C1292856;C1292856;C0430740;C0430740;C0043143;C0026838;C0087111;C0184666;C0012621;C0031843;C0016540;C0031843;C3714552;C0034606;C1552601;C0031843;C2828392;C0031843;C0518461;C2004454;C0308779;C0183115;C0032042;C0032042;C0016536;C0204695;C3244286;C0038454;C0595905;C0038454;C3810851;C0282443;C0038454;C0282443;C1305866;C0560560;C0947630;C0439044;C0006104;C0947630;C0947630;C0392366;C1553496;C0034546;C0006104;C1553496;C1706074;C0947630;C0036270;C0392366;C1706074;C1706074;C1706074;C0918012;C0002658;C0175659;C1551040;C0578671;C3850024;C1552861;C3850024;C0182158;C0018670;C0441633;C3850024;C3850024;C0181620;C0541749;C0181620;C0392366;C0018563;C0580846;C0181620;C0175722;C0392366;C1527305;C0018563;C0004600;C0015392;C1561538;C0446516;C0042789;C0589121;C0886384;C0086960;C1550655;C1550655;C1550655;C1550655;C1550655;C0000589;C0683314;C1696103;C1561542;C0655359;C0308779;C0031809;C0181797;C0181797;C0031809;C0233697;C0087130,C0038454,C0151740;C0151740;C0027853;C0007222;C0007222;C0740858;C0003873;C0430056;C0004936;C0002395;C0009241;C0003811;C0588008;C0850338;C0040128;C0011849;C0014544;C0007770;C0427244;C0155765;C0152025;C0242889;C0038917;C0008909;C0006147;C0038917;C0008909;C0022658;C0279752;C0040132;C1457868;C0815275;C0013227;C0684336;C0031809;C0684336;C0810633;C0810633;C0013146;C0011570;C0810633;C0184666;C0006121;C0221423;C0024109;C0012634;C0032961;C0032961;C0810633;C0205082;C0014544;C0443343;C0011849;C0021102;C0021102;C0442711;C0549206;C0014544;C0012634;C0021102;C0549206;C0038454;C0221198;C0262512;C0012634;C0199168;C0021102;C0262512;C0001962;C0022646;C0033213;C0204695;C0542560;C1553386;C0038454;C0205082;C0205082;C0205082;C0205082;C1550512;C0006826;C3539125;C0205082;C0006086;C0725694;C1299582;C1518681;C0006086;C0006141;C1300072;C0018787;C0024109;C0006104;C0018670;C0376335;C0018670;C0436548;C1301624;C1301624;C0026650;C0184661;C0184661;C0721578;C1550655;C1550655;C1550655;C1550655;C1550655;C0033213;C1550655;C1550655;C1550655;C1550655;C1550655;C1550655;C1550655;C0009195;C1550655;C0033213;C0009195;C0598463;C0026605;C1548428;C4684637;C1320102;C1320102;C0007765;C0040038;C0220825;C0220825;C3534109;C4331837;C3843322;C0001613;C0031809;C0033348;C3272565;C1547226;C0022116;C3272565;C3843408;C0019080,C1552596;C0038819,20090521,,,Completed,22579647,18,18.0,0.002797602039537,0.003912143661871

Since there is a lack of      rehabilitation programs that encompass all dimensions of a stroke survivor's life researchers      agree upon the need for a rehabilitation program that addresses both the social and physical      needs of the patients. The aim with the project is to investigate whether it is possible to      improve the life situation among patients with a history of stroke through a rhythm and music      method and therapeutic riding. To get insights in the underlying mechanisms our research also      focuses on relevant physiological, neurobiological and psychosocial mechanisms induced by the      interventions. The hypothesis is that both treatment methods will mainly enhance      participants' degree of participation.      The study is a randomized controlled trial where about 123 participants (50-75 years old) who      had their stroke incident 1 - 5 years ago will be consecutively included and randomly      allocated to the following three groups: a) Ronnie Gardiner Rhythm Music Method (RGRM) b)      therapeutic riding c) a control group receiving RGRM after 9 months. Treatment proceeds      during 12 weeks and evaluation takes place pre- and post intervention, and 12 and 24 weeks      after the treatment is finalized. The evaluation consists of a thorough neuropsychological      assessment, a physiotherapeutic assessment, sampling of blood and questionnaires covering      mental, psychosocial, physical and psychological well-being. Interviews are also conducted in      order to map the participants' experiences from the two treatment programs. Specially      designed interviews are also planned to be carried through with participants having aphasia.      So far, there is only empirical support suggesting that RGRM has positive effects for      individuals with a history of stroke making it significant to carry out research with the aim      to contribute to strengthening the evidence of the method. A positive outcome would increase      the scientific basis for this alternative treatment thus facilitating further research and      implementation in everyday clinical practice.",,Nervous System Diseases;Cardiovascular Diseases;,C0087111;C2004454;C0087111;C0376691;C0871269;C0038454;C0026867,C0087111;C2004454;C0087111;C0376691;C0871269;C0038454;C0026867,C0282440;C0034991;C0599766;C0034991;C0034394;C0886296;C1306597;C1458132;C0349676;C1458132;C0184661;C1458132;C1292856;C0596545;C0424093;C0026605;C0220825;C0220825;C0031809;C0031809;C0376649;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C1446409;C0332149;C0233820;C0441621;C1446409;C1446409;C0237607;C3540008;C0262512;C0025663;C0699809;C0003537;C0262512;C0038454;C0038454;C0871269;C0025663;C0542560;C0038454;C1552839;C0871269;C0025663;C0229992;C0038454;C0025663;C0947630;C0006104;C0026867;C0947630;C0026867;C0005767;C0699809;C0087111;C0087111;C0935630;C0935630;C0184511;C3843286;C1518681;C4067746;C0027902;C0311392;C1561542;C1552839;C1522411;C0042070;C0031809;C0042070;C3272565;C4698437,C0038454,C0014544;C1145677;C0886296;C0302828;C0184661;C0184661;C0302828;C0231170;C0162340;C0220825;C0231170;C0162340;C0220825;C0087111;C3495449;C0332218;C0522224;C0085281;C0087111;C0687696;C0020517;C0012634;C0012634;C0025663;C0038454;C0038454;C1555670;C3263723;C0944911;C3263723;C0038454;C0595998;C0018787;C0015726;C1561543;C1561543;C0024487;C0024487;C0446516;C0087111;C0087111;C1280910;C0012634;C1830410;C1830410;C3242430;C0041674;C1140607;C0451227;C2911690;C4086543;C0429964;C0018792;C1522411;C0018792;C4331837;C1553756;C1156284;C0022116;C1704289;C1704289;C0019080,C1140111,20140602,,,Completed,28619985;23171380,9,4.5,0.0027830216465940002,0.003880734009329

NCT02399540,1,Late LTP-like Plasticity Effects of tDCS in Chronic Stroke Patients,,Stroke;Paresis;,Inclusion Criteria:          -  Chronic (> 6 months) stroke patient          -  Aged 18-79 years          -  Motor deficit in the upper limb due to the stroke        Exclusion Criteria:          -  Absence of recordable MEPs from the ADM after TMS          -  Absence of voluntary movement (Fugl-Meyer < III)          -  Head injury or the presence of intracranial metal or intracranial lesions          -  History of cranial irradiation          -  History of epilepsy          -  Presence of a pacemaker          -  Taking anticonvulsant or neuroleptic medication          -  Substance abuse          -  Inability to understand instructions          -  History of psychiatric disorders,"Rationale: About 80% of stroke patients suffer motor impairments, but current therapies have      limited effects on motor recovery. Therefore, investigating new potential therapeutic      approaches is crucial. Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a form of      non-invasive electrical stimulation where a weak current is applied through electrodes over      the scalp. This stimulation is known to (1) induce changes in neuronal excitability -which      can last up to one day with late LTP-like plasticity protocols- in a polarity and      site-specific manner, and (2) facilitate motor learning and stroke recovery. However, it is      unknown how the motor cortex excitability changes that follow tDCS relate to the increase in      motor learning and recovery potential. The currently upheld hypothesis is that motor learning      needs to be synchronized in time with electrical stimulation (paired stimulation), but recent      results from our lab suggest that tDCS also increases skill learning after stimulation has      ended (unpaired stimulation). If this is true, tDCS has a much larger therapeutic window and      is a more valuable clinical tool than currently believed. Therefore, the investigators want      to investigate how late LTP-like plasticity tDCS affects the increase in skill learning      normally seen with tDCS when applied 24 hours before training. The outcome of this study can      provide important guidelines on effective motor therapy during stroke rehabilitation.      Objective: Identify the effect of late LTP-like plasticity tDCS in chronic stroke patients on      skill learning 24 hours later.      Study design: Double-blinded, randomized between-subjects trials. Study population: Chronic      stroke patients. Main study parameters/endpoints: The main objective of the study is to      determine the effect of late LTP-like plasticity tDCS on skill learning 24 hours later. As a      motor learning paradigm, the investigators will use a circuit tracking task which chronic      stroke patients perform better if tDCS is applied concurrently. During this task, patients      have to trace a cursor over a circuit as fast and accurately as possible by moving a computer      mouse. Skill will be quantified by calculating a combined speed/ accuracy score and skill      improvement compared to baseline (LI; the learning index) will be compared between the sham,      conventional unpaired tDCS, conventional paired tDCS groups and the late LTP-like plasticity      tDCS groups.",,"Nervous System Diseases;Cardiovascular Diseases;Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;",C1547296;C0038454;C0870814;C3850024;C1550655;C1831583,C1140111,C3850024;C0013786;C0013786;C0204097;C0871370;C0871370;C0871370;C0871370;C0235169;C0026607;C0235169;C1292856;C1292856;C1292856;C1292856;C0162791;C0087111;C0018017;C0018017;C1552740;C0023185;C0023185;C0023185;C0023185;C0332149;C0023185;C1556133;C0087111;C1547296;C0038454;C0683278;C0038454;C1518681;C0038454;C0038454;C1518681;C0038454;C0560560;C1552839;C1552839;C0036270;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0918012;C3850024;C3714552;C0870814;C3850024;C3850024;C3850024;C0870814;C3850024;C3850024;C0870814;C3850024;C0870814;C3850024;C3850024;C3850024;C3850024;C0870814;C3850024;C1578513;C1561538;C0087111;C0087111;C0684336;C0442711;C1516986;C0442694;C2004454;C2004454;C2004454;C1555587;C0595938;C1518681;C1831583;C1831583;C1831583;C1831583;C1831583;C3844714;C4084912;C0002658;C0671679;C1522485;C3534109;C1334278;C3272565;C0728774;C3834249;C4082977,,C0004936;C0581296;C0079172;C0740858;C0003286;C0524466;C0302828;C0018674;C0040615;C1140618;C0013227;C0162340;C0030163;C0392148;C0014544;C0150312;C1547296;C0262926;C0262926;C0262926;C0038454;C0038454;C0436548;C0521654;C0427086;C1561542,C1140111,20160501,,,Completed,28751226,1,1.0,0.0030253000148670003,0.0037895209273840005

Patients having previous history of shoulder pain          7. Any previous history of skin allergy to tape,"Background and Rationale: The most commonly seen disabilities in stroke patients are shoulder      injuries such as shoulder pain, glenohumeral subluxation, spasticity of shoulder muscles,      soft-tissue trauma, rotator cuff tears, and shoulder-hand syndrome.      Taping is widely used in the field of rehabilitation as both means of treatment and      prevention of sports related injuries. Scarce information is available regarding the use of      shoulder taping in preventing shoulder injuries in stroke patients. Aims:      To find out the effectiveness of taping technique with conventional treatment versus sham      taping and conventional treatment in prevention of shoulder injuries in patients with acute      stroke.      Hypothesis:      Taping technique with conventional treatment will be superior to conventional treatment alone      in preventing shoulder injuries in patients with acute stroke.      Methods Research setting: Stroke unit, department of Neurology, Christian Medical College      (CMC) Ludhiana, Punjab, India and College of Physiotherapy, CMC Ludhiana.      Study design: prospective, randomized, outcome blinded trial (PROBE design). Study period:      Prospective for 18 months from May 2009 All stroke patients with upper limb weakness within      48 hours after the ictus and with Brunnstrom's stage of recovery 1 and 2 will be included in      the study. Patients will be randomized into two groups using lottery method. The treatment      arm group(Group I) include shoulder taping with conventional techniques that is(positioning,      handling technique and passive range of motion exercises) and the control arm (Group II)      include sham taping with conventional techniques with sham taping. A total of 80 patients in      each group will be included. The plastic micropore and elastic adhesive tape will be used for      taping the affected shoulder. The sham taping will be done using the same tapes but without      stretching the concerned muscles and joints. The tapes will be changed every 3 days and will      remain for 14 days. The outcome measures are as follows; Primary: Pain: Visual Analog Scale      and Activities of daily living: Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI); Secondary: Range      of motion: using a Goniometer. The outcome will be assessed by an independent physiotherapist      who will be blinded to the clinical details. Patients will be followed-up at 14 days and 30      days.

These deficits in      coordination are expressed in the form of abnormal muscle synergies and result in limited and      stereotypic movement patterns that are functionally disabling. The result of these      constraints in muscle synergies is an abnormal coupling between shoulder abduction and elbow      flexion (i.e. the flexion synergy), which significantly reduces the reaching function of an      individual with stroke when they lift up the weight of the impaired arm against gravity. The      investigators previous neurotherapeutic research, supported by a NIDRR Field Initiated      research grant, has shown that the abnormal synergy between shoulder abduction and elbow      flexion can be significantly reduced thus increasing total reaching range of motion in      individuals with severe stroke. The previous work established progressive abduction loading      as a key element to the rehabilitation of reaching. Although individuals with severe stroke      benefited from the investigators previous work, residual flexion synergy continued to hinder      normal arm function in most participants with severe stroke. This study will utilize the      ACT3D robot, developed as part of the investigators previous NIDRR project, to incorporate      resistance to reaching while accounting for the known benefits of progressive abduction      loading. The investigators propose to randomize forty participants with severe stroke into      two closely related interventions. The groups will both practice reaching under abduction      loading, however, the experimental group will also move against resistance while reaching.      Rigorous and quantitative investigation of therapeutic elements such as resistance to      reaching and progressive abduction loading is only possible with a device such as the ACT3D.      the investigators will be able to standardize the delivery of each intervention using      kinematic and kinetic parameters, which will allow for a clear identification of the      therapeutic effect of resistance to reaching. the investigators hypothesize that resistance      to reaching in combination with progressive abduction loading will further increase dynamic      multi-joint strength, increase total reaching range of motion, and increase arm function thus      enhancing actual amount of use of the arm, participation in life roles, and quality of life      in individuals with severe stroke.",arm;strength;coordination;physical therapy;robotics;stroke;synergy;,Nervous System Diseases;Cardiovascular Diseases;,C0237834;C2584321;C1547296;C0205082;C0038454;C0018563;C3165543;C1171411,C0237834;C2584321;C1547296;C0205082;C0038454;C0018563;C3165543;C1171411,C0599766;C0427096;C0080078;C0080078;C0518214;C0034991;C0886296;C1552578;C0184661;C0231456;C0231456;C0231456;C0231456;C0231456;C0231456;C0231456;C0205161;C0205161;C0037004;C0031843;C0205161;C0037004;C0031843;C0237607;C0332149;C0011209;C0031843;C0038454;C0038454;C1305866;C0205082;C0038454;C0205082;C0038454;C1553386;C0205082;C0038454;C0205082;C0038454;C1552839;C1518681;C0205082;C0038454;C0013769;C0013769;C0947630;C0181620;C0560560;C1299581;C0446516;C0446516;C0446516;C0446516;C0087111;C0087111;C3539181;C0020792;C0520966;C0520966;C0233492;C0162340;C0237834;C0237834;C0237834;C0237834;C0237834;C3839460;C3839460;C3839460;C3839460;C2363670;C1880258;C0449878;C1552839;C1254223;C0404831;C0038272;C0221106;C0026649;C1548344;C1548344;C1548344;C1548344;C1548344;C1548344;C4086497;C1548344;C1548344;C1548344;C1548344;C3834249;C1525443;C1525443;C1525443;C0007009;C1525443;C1444662,C0038454,C1140618;C0020538;C0684336;C1140618;C0684336;C0684336;C0376636;C0012634;C0030552;C0030193;C0205082;C0037949;C0015385;C0033213;C1555587;C0009797,,20150701,,,Completed,29515514,3,3.0,0.0025912589023929997,0.003589030183894

Exclusion Criteria:          -  age below 18          -  admission to the ED more than 4 hours after symptoms onset or unknown time of first             symptoms,"Acute stroke management represents a true medical emergency that requires prompt diagnosis      and urgent treatment. In a previous exhaustive cohort study conducted in the Rhône region,      France (AVC69) (Porthault et al. 2013) the investigators observed that only a small      percentage of patients could access to thrombolysis in time. In this cohort of 1306 patients      treated in one of the emergency department of the Rhone region for a suspected stroke, 84% of      patients reached hospital through an emergency department instead of going directly to a      stroke unit. Among those patients, only 2% were finally thrombolysed. A significant part of      patients arrived in the emergency department too late to be thrombolysed. However, among the      subset of ischemic stroke patients who reach emergency department less than 3 hours after      symptoms onset, and who had no clinical or radiological exclusion criteria for thrombolysis,      only 15 % were thrombolysed. The hypothesis was that an intervention designed to improve ED      professional's knowledge and skills and to develop together efficient clinical pathway would      decrease door-to imaging time and consequently door-to needle time and eventually improve      overall thrombolysis rate.      The investigators have conducted a cluster randomized controlled stepped wedge trial. All      adult patients with suspected stroke arriving in one of the participating ED were included in      the study along five successive four-month periods. The program featured: development of      written materials (booklets) and video (film), and one day session of standardized training      for trainers, at least one nurse and one physician of all EDs, with formal presentation to      improve knowledge, and simulation to improve skills for using the ""FAST"" tool (nurses) and      the ""NIHSS"" score (ED physicians). Additionally, a clinical pathway was developed to adapt      general evidence based guidelines to the local organization.

In particular, traditional use of pharmacological      agents to alter motor function post-stroke is directed primarily at reducing the ""positive""      signs following upper motor neuron lesion, in particular spasticity, or enhanced,      velocity-dependent stretch reflex responses to imposed stretch. While pharmacological      management of spasticity certainly suppresses clinical and quantitative measures of      hypertonia, there is little improvement in functional performance. In contrast, preliminary      data on the administration of 5HT agents following neurological injury indicates an increase      in motor performance (Pariente 2001) and recovery (Dam 1996), despite an increase in spastic      motor activity (Stolp-Smith 1999; see Preliminary Data below). Understanding methods to      maximize function following stroke despite potential, short-term increases in spastic motor      activity may improve therapeutic intervention strategies. The general objective of this study      is therefore to:        1. quantify the effects of short-term SSRI administration on voluntary and spastic motor           behaviors in individuals with chronic spastic hemiparesis,        2. identify the changes in impairments and functional recovery of walking ability during           BWSTT with the presence or absence of SSRIs.",pharmacology;rehabilitation;locomotion;,Nervous System Diseases;Cardiovascular Diseases;,C0242701;C2004454;C0038454,C0242701;C2004454;C0038454,C0235834;C0087111;C0751792;C0599766;C0870921;C4505218;C0034991;C1533734;C1533734;C0886296;C0162340;C0018989;C0026838;C0376636;C0026838;C0026826;C0679199;C0429964;C0018017;C0677505;C0031843;C1446409;C0031843;C0392148;C0600080;C0600080;C0443306;C0025663;C0443306;C0443306;C0443306;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0947630;C0947630;C0360105;C3245479;C0042789;C0684336;C1704632;C2004454;C0184511;C0424530;C3242430;C1518681;C3844714;C1716046;C0031843;C3543419;C0449900;C3858576;C0441229;C1547298;C4522152;C3272565;C4049938;C4049938,C0038454,C0262593;C0023216;C3887460;C0029456;C0013227;C0038454;C0038454;C0002658;C0360105;C0016928;C0042497;C1444783;C2707259;C0332534;C1561542,,20120101,,,Completed,26376447,1,1.0,0.0031713173872340004,0.003547717708837

Patients will be evaluated by a      blinded assessor on five occasions: twice within two weeks at baseline before intervention      start (BL, T0), once after eight treatment sessions (T1), once after the intervention (T2),      and once after a two month follow-up period (FU). Figure 1 illustrates the study overview.      The study focuses on the evaluation of the YouGrabber efficacy compared to conventional      therapy in an outpatient setting.      Research question: Do patients after stroke in the YouGrabber training group show higher      postintervention performance in the Box and Block Test (BBT) compared to patients in the      conventional therapy group? Hypothesis: H0: The investigators hypothesise that there will be      no group differences after 16 training sessions or after the two month follow-up period.      H1: The investigators hypothesise that there will be a group difference after the 16 training      sessions and after the two month follow-up period.      Aim: The aim of the project is to design and implement a single-blinded, randomised      controlled multi-centre trial comparing YouGrabber training and conventional therapy in      patients after stroke.      Patients will be randomly allocated to either the experimental group (EG) or the control      group (CG) after the second ME (T0). Group allocation will be based on a computer-generated      randomisation list (one for each centre, (MATLAB, 2007b, Mathworks Inc., USA) created by a      researcher not involved into the study. Randomisation lists and corresponding token will be      stored in the clinics' pharmacy. Patients will draw a token before the first therapy session.      The token will be marked and stored until study finalisation in the pharmacy.      Group allocation will remain concealed for the independent assessor until study finalisation.      Patients and treating therapists will be reminded not to talk about patient's group      allocation with other therapists or participants.      Patients in both study groups (EG, CG) will receive the same amount of 16 sessions lasting      for 45 minutes each. During each therapy appointment patients can decide to stop the training      at any time.

Persistent motor impairment is common with often incomplete recovery of motor function in      response to rehabilitation, mainly in the upper limbs. Robot-mediated therapy has been      proposed as a viable approach for the rehabilitation of the upper limb, but as the evidence      quality is low, more rigorous studies are needed. Previous studies have focused on the      effects of devices acting on a limited number of joints, often limiting the workspace on a      plane.

It is called the      ExStroke Pilot Trial.      Physical activity is associated with a lower risk of first-time stroke. It remains unknown if      physical activity also is associated with a lower risk of recurrent stroke. Patients with      ischaemic stroke have a 30% to 40% risk of a recurrent stroke during a 5 year follow-up. The      risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI) and death from vascular disease is approximately 15%      each. The impact of lifestyle factors on risk for these events is insufficiently covered in      the international scientific literature.      Purpose:      The purpose of the trial is to examine whether the level of physical activity increases in      patients who have had an ischemic stroke, when they are informed about physical activity and      instructed in a physical training program. The occurrence of new cerebro- and cardiovascular      events in the patients will be registered. The patients are randomised to receive oral and      written information by a physician and a physiotherapist about physical exercise; or to a      control group with no instruction regarding physical exercise. Both groups will receive the      best available therapy with regard to secondary stroke prevention and will be informed about      lifestyle factors.      Irrespective of which group the patients are randomised to, all patients will receive the      best possible established treatment with regard to prevention of thromboses; blood pressure      control; lipid lowering agents, if necessary; and information about diet, tobacco smoking,      and vitamin supplements.      Study Design:      The patients will be randomised centrally within 90 days after stroke onset, and they will be      re-examined at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months. Inclusion criteria are patients with ischaemic      stroke, aged 40 years or older. In the pilot trial a number of 300 included patients is      wanted.",Physical activity;cerebral infarct;,Nervous System Diseases;Cardiovascular Diseases;,C0031809;C1522704;C0038454;C1547229,C1140111,C0155626;C1277289;C0948008;C0948008;C0042373;C0948008;C3887460;C0005823;C2983265;C0302828;C0023866;C0199176;C0027627;C0087111;C0031809;C0332149;C0332128;C1706244;C1556133;C0087111;C0042890;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C1552839;C0038454;C0038454;C0947630;C0011065;C1561543;C1578513;C0086440;C0452240;C0442694;C0452240;C0452240;C4699619;C1550655;C0000589;C3242430;C3242430;C3842337;C1514821;C0040053;C0178520;C0178520;C0178520;C2348188;C0804815;C0022116;C0562357;C0562357;C1561542;C0018792;C1552839;C1552839;C1555709;C0949766;C0031809;C4049938;C0031809;C0031809;C0031809;C1947943,C0038454,C0151699;C0040405;C0332140;C0027627;C0235946;C0162340;C0043143;C0021308;C2945640;C0677042;C0441633;C0021308;C1551395;C0012634;C0038454;C1553386;C0038454;C0043016;C0566415;C0038454;C0006104;C1527305;C1299581;C0006856;C1578513;C1561538;C4699619;C1550655;C1457887;C1550655;C0021308;C1457887;C1550655;C1552867;C1550655;C3809247;C3242430;C3242430;C0699794;C1555709;C3534109;C0018792;C0018792;C3272565,C0031809;C0021308,20071001,,,Completed,19900934;18029233,23,11.5,0.0027689746135599997,0.0035288547887609998

It combines the profound experience of the      clinic Hildebrand in neurocognitive therapy - involving brain and mind in the task and      training both the motor and the sensory system - with the advanced haptic robotic technology      of the Rehabilitation Engineering Lab at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich      (ETH Zurich), allowing unmet interaction with the hand through the simulation of virtual      objects with various mechanical properties. In a randomized controlled clinical trial, 10      sub-acute stroke patients will receive four weeks of robotic therapy sessions, integrated      seamlessly into their daily rehabilitation program, while 10 other patients will receive      conventional therapy. The investigators will assess baseline performance in an initial      clinical and robotic assessment, with another assessment at the end of the four-week period,      and in follow-ups four weeks and six months later. The contents of the patient-tailored      robotic therapy sessions will match those of the conventional therapy as closely as possible.      This study will demonstrate the feasibility of including robotic therapy of hand function      into the daily rehabilitation program, and investigate the acceptance from patients and      therapists. The investigators expect increased training intensity during the robotic therapy      session compared to conventional sessions with similar contents, as well as novel insights      into the recovery process of both the motor and the sensory system during the four weeks of      therapy, through advanced robotic assessments integrated into the training sessions. This      project is a first step towards making such robotic therapy available to patients as      integration into the conventional individual therapy program (e.g. for self-training), and      towards transferring this technology to the home environment.",stroke;acute;rehabilitation;robot therapy;hand function;fine motor skills;neurocognitive;sensory;Perfetti;haptics;,"Nervous System Diseases;Cardiovascular Diseases;Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;",C0518895;C0034991;C1705273;C0038454;C0018563,C0518895;C0034991;C1705273;C0038454;C0018563,C0936233;C0034991;C0034991;C2945704;C2945704;C0204525;C0518895;C0034991;C0562230;C0562230;C0751956;C1261322;C0237607;C0031809;C0031809;C1552853;C0332149;C1552853;C0233820;C0087111;C1553497;C3540008;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0038454;C0025344;C0679622;C0006104;C0947630;C0679622;C0229992;C0018563;C1561540;C1551994;C0087111;C0589120;C0442694;C0442694;C0442694;C0442694;C2004454;C4284173;C0183210;C0183210;C0679064;C0011167;C0233697;C0233697;C0233697;C0233697;C1561542;C0080194;C0220825;C0728774;C3272565;C0233697;C1292856;C0151576,,C0679009;C0009241;C1140618;C1140618;C0278140;C0810633;C0522224;C3714552;C0021102;C0542560;C0030552;C0003537;C0038454;C0221198;C0205082;C0205082;C0205082;C0175659;C0446516;C0035435;C1550655;C1320102,,20170609,,,Completed,25399249,8,8.0,0.002790930402837,0.0035082785049050003

Treatments for CP are generally ineffective, and      have traditionally focused on the weak body rather than the injured brain. Understanding how      the newborn brain responds to injuries like stroke (plasticity) carries the greatest      potential for better treatments. We propose to study the ability of two interventions to      modulate brain plasticity toward better function in children with stroke-induced CP. One is a      rehabilitation method called constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT), the other is a type      of non-invasive brain stimulation called transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). TMS is safe      and comfortable for children and we recently showed it could improve motor function in      children with stroke.      We will perform a special study to test both treatments simultaneously. Children 7-18 years      with stroke-induced CP will be recruited into the study from across Alberta. Each child will      randomly receive either TMS, CIMT, both, or neither each day for two weeks while attending      our new HemiKids Power Camp for motor learning. Improvements will be measured by trained      therapists over 1 year. TMS will also measure brain plasticity, both initially and following      treatment. Our lead investigator is an expert in both newborn stroke and TMS and has      assembled an experienced team of accomplished collaborators to ensure the completion of this      important work. This will be the largest study of children with CP examined in this manner.      This will be the first clinical trial of non-invasive brain stimulation (TMS) in CP, the      largest trial of CIMT (and the first exclusive to newborn stroke), and the first study      allowing the direct comparison of two different therapies. In establishing the first      dedicated pediatric TMS laboratory in Canada, we will be the first to measure plasticity      changes in newborn stroke, advancing new treatments of this previously untreatable and      disabling disease.      Patient recruitment is currently underway at Alberta Children's Hospital. Application is      currently underway to expand recruitment to Northern Alberta through the Glenrose      Rehabilitation Hospital and Stollery Children's Hospital, to enable patients from Northern      Alberta greater opportunity to participate as subjects in this study.",Perinatal stroke;Periventricular venous infarction;Presumed perinatal stroke;Neonatal stroke;Arterial ischemic stroke;Fetal stroke;Transcranial magnetic stimulation;Constraint-induced movement therapy;CIMT;Cerebral palsy;Congenital hemiplegia;Hemiplegic cerebral palsy;Neuroplasticity;Developmental plasticity;,Nervous System Diseases;Cardiovascular Diseases;,C0038454;C0006104;C1831583,C0038454;C0006104;C1831583,C0436548;C0870227;C0870227;C0596452;C0454279;C0007789;C0034991;C1096775;C0034991;C0162340;C0886296;C0271510;C1947919;C0271510;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C3263723;C0031843;C0031843;C0023185;C0332128;C1551035;C0699809;C1551035;C1551035;C1551035;C1550655;C0038454;C3245511;C0038454;C0038454;C0025663;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C3244286;C0038454;C0562342;C0006104;C0006104;C0947630;C0006104;C0947630;C0947630;C0006104;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C3714552;C0392366;C1561543;C1442948;C0436548;C0436548;C0436548;C1561538;C1578513;C0436548;C0436548;C0436548;C0436548;C1578513;C0237607;C0184511;C0080194;C0001721;C1831583;C1831583;C1831583;C0022885;C1831583;C4084912;C3812868;C0011167;C0018792;C1334278;C1334278;C3817378;C3817378;C0701928;C1881720;C0220644,C0522224,C3714756;C0038220;C1136201;C1301624;C1140618;C0006055;C1140618;C1140618;C2599718;C0270611;C0184661;C0018989;C1140999;C1516879;C0013227;C1140618;C0750484;C0021485;C0031843;C0039082;C1549439;C0443343;C0014544;C0031843;C0025663;C0036572;C0262512;C0038454;C0024763;C0025344;C0038454;C0205082;C0725694;C0947630;C1561542;C0947630;C1561542;C0947630;C0018563;C1299581;C0018563;C1550557;C1550557;C1114365;C0436548;C1578513;C0087111;C0237607;C3843228;C0587599;C4699604;C1546410;C0034991;C0475455;C0030971;C0684336;C1704258;C0018991;C3543419;C0021102;C3858576;C0332534;C1561542;C1561542;C0231221;C2827624;C0600109;C4522152,C0006104;C1831583;C0022116;C0026649;C0231696,20140301,,,Unknown status,27029628,15,15.0,0.003129945864295,0.0034907558361270004

Inclusion Criteria:          -  All patients with a Danish personal identification number, referred to one of the two             regional stroke centres, during a 6-month period will be included. The 6 month period             will begin after the above mentioned 500 registration form has been collected, to             avoid bias.        Exclusion Criteria:","Annually 12.000 people i Denmark suffer from a stroke. Treatment for ischemic stroke is      available, but only 12% of stroke patients receive it.      The treatment is only available within a time frame of 4,5 hours from symptom onset, thus the      Emergency Medical Services (EMS) is essential to fast and effective stroke treatment.      The aim of this study is:        1. To establish the rate of recognition of stroke symptoms by healthcare personnel in the           EMD, ultimately aiming at optimizing performance, and identifying barriers for a fast           and correct EMS-response.        2. To assess prehospital time consumption by ambulance personnel on the scene of a stroke,           create a baseline for future comparison and generate explorative hypotheses for           forthcoming interventions.      The overall aim of this study is, to ensure the best possible prehospital care for all stroke      patients. The study will determine, if the EMD is at a high and international level in      regards to stroke recognition, and if there is a potential to decrease on-scene time. This      will serve as future comparison and have an effect on the structure and future education in      the prehospital services, and potentially improve the outcome after acute ischemic stroke.",Prehospital;EMS;EMD;Stroke;Dispatch;,"Nervous System Diseases;Cardiovascular Diseases;Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;",C0013961;C0038454;C1550655;C0376636,C0013961;C4277718;C0220825;C0002422;C0038454;C1550655;C0376636,C0013961;C0948008;C0948008;C0886296;C0524637;C0524637;C0086388;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0002422;C0424927;C1704632;C0332149;C1457887;C0683278;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C1518681;C0180979;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0340861;C0340861;C2735049;C0442797;C1457887;C1706912;C0184511;C1947907;C0011164;C0728774;C1704289;C0612923;C4082977,,C0013961;C0007787;C1300638;C1300638;C0809783;C1553384;C1546399;C0034975;C0034975;C0242356;C0242356;C0242356;C1550655;C3245509;C0038454;C1137110;C0038454;C1137110;C0038454;C0025344;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0025344;C0025344;C1561542;C0805701;C0805701;C0805701;C1550655;C1552867;C1550655;C1552867;C1514821;C1514821;C2735115;C0019080;C0150312;C0022116;C1550488;C1550488,,20150501,,,Completed,30626404;27388490,4,2.0,0.00324192836267,0.003429788540821

We will not randomize patients on the basis of        side of stroke or hand dominance but will undertake secondary data analyses examining these        variables. In past applications of one form of RTP, CI therapy, to chronic stroke patients        in the laboratories of Taub and Miltner, there were no significant differences in treatment        effects for patients with right and left-sided strokes. In previous evaluations of CI        therapy, Taub did not find any difference in outcomes among the small percentage of        patients with pre-morbid left dominance. Therefore, there is no reason to exclude these        patients from participation. We believe that the motivation to improve use of an affected        pre-stroke non-dominant upper extremity is sufficiently strong to support profound        improvement from treating that limb as well as from treating the dominant limb.        Distributions of dominance and hand preference have been acquired from patients meeting        eligibility criteria in 1998 at several sites for determining participation of sites for        the EXCITE trial and side of cerebral pathology showed remarkably equal left-right        distribution.        Exclusion criteria          1. a score of less than 24 on the Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination or a score of 36             or below on the Token Test of the Multilingual Aphasia Examination          2. a first stroke less than 3 months or more than 9 months prior to the initiation of             therapy          3. less than 18 years old          4. clinical judgment of excessive frailty or lack of stamina (e.g., cannot attend to             instructions, stay awake, engage in functional activities, etc.)          5. serious uncontrolled medical conditions          6. excessive pain in any joint of the more affected extremity that could limit ability to             cooperate with the intervention, as judged by the examining clinician          7. passive range of motion less than 45 degrees for: abduction, flexion or external             rotation at shoulder, or pronation of forearm; or greater than 30 degrees flexion             contracture at any finger joint (patients who pass the motor criteria specified above             do not tend to have the type of pain or limitation of movement that would exclude them             from treatment)          8. unable to stand independently for 2 min., transfer independently to and from the             toilet or perform sit-to-stand          9. current participation in other pharmacological or physical intervention studies, or             have received injections of anti-spasticity drugs into upper extremity musculature             within the past 3 months, or wish to have drugs injected in the foreseeable future         10. receiving any anti-spasticity drugs orally at the time of expected participation         11. received phenol injections less than 12 months prior to receiving therapy         12. contemplating a move from proximity to the treatment site in less than 1 year from the             randomization date. Prospective patients who qualify but who have profound postural             instability will undergo the intervention while walking with contact guarding or, when             feasible, using their leg(s) and more involved arm to propel a wheelchair.","Many patients who have sustained strokes are unable to effectively use their hemiparetic      upper extremity. Limited mobility in the performance of daily activities, such as eating or      dressing, adversely affects their quality of life and compromises independence.      Rehabilitation techniques engaging the hemiparetic limb in repetitive task practice (RTP) may      improve upper extremity function and quality of life in patients with stroke, but costs limit      the number of patients that can utilize this type of therapy. Advances in microprocessor      design and function make the use of an assistive device as an adjunct to RTP plausible. An      innovative assistive repetitive motion (ARM) device using an ""air muscle"" has been developed      specifically for the rehabilitation of the hemiparetic upper extremity. The primary aim of      the proposed study is to collect pilot data to estimate the clinical effectiveness of using      the ARM device in conjunction with RTP to improve upper extremity motor function and the      quality of life of patients with stroke. Twenty sub-acute (3 to 9 mos. post-stoke) patients      will be randomized to a RTP only or ARM + RTP group. The RTP group will receive 15 days (4      hours per day) of intensive one-on-one RTP therapy. The ARM + RTP group will use the ARM      device for 2 hours per day and receive 2 hours of intensive RTP per day for 15 days. Clinical      motor function and quality of life measures will be taken before and after the interventions      and two months later. We hypothesize that the ARM + RTP group will exhibit greater      improvements in motor function and quality of life measures than the RTP only group.","stroke, rehabilitation, robotics;",Nervous System Diseases;Cardiovascular Diseases;,C1140618;C4083049;C0038454;C0034991;C3536832;C0237607,C1140618;C4083049;C0038454;C0034991;C3536832;C0237607,C0700572;C0036605;C1140618;C0518214;C1140618;C0518214;C1140618;C1140618;C0518214;C0518214;C0518214;C0034991;C0034991;C4553491;C0886296;C2945640;C0013119;C0425152;C0237607;C0031843;C0031843;C0031843;C3272565;C0031843;C0031843;C0038454;C0087111;C0087111;C0015272;C0566415;C0013470;C0038454;C0038454;C0947630;C0015385;C3245479;C0446516;C0446516;C0026987;C0446516;C1561538;C0446516;C0446516;C1561538;C1561538;C0446516;C0439857;C2360800;C0725066;C0184511;C0184511;C0001721;C0013987;C2363670;C1561542;C1552839;C1552839;C1552839;C1552839;C1552839;C0185414;C3272565;C0034770,C0038454,C0451326;C0695584;C1096775;C1140618;C0422881;C0080078;C0560885;C1140618;C0886296;C0185125;C0302828;C0184661;C0184661;C0220825;C0031809;C0026605;C0589507;C0723446;C0021485;C0026838;C0026838;C0021485;C0043143;C0027627;C0332128;C0087111;C0677042;C0015385;C0332128;C1550470;C0231456;C0033421;C0087111;C0087111;C3245488;C0006104;C0022423;C0037004;C0087111;C0038454;C0087111;C1552867;C0087111;C0424594;C0518031;C0542560;C0016536;C0542560;C1552867;C0087111;C3245509;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0016129;C0031428;C0596013;C0013227;C0013227;C0013227;C0018563;C3245479;C0015385;C0015385;C0022885;C0030193;C0030193;C0560560;C1561543;C0728713;C0446516;C1378698;C0012634;C4699604;C1286272;C0728827;C1550655;C1552867;C0184511;C1378698;C1290940;C1290940;C0013893;C1995013;C1444783;C0085632;C1518681;C2328206;C0425152;C1140607;C4048188;C3844714;C4055646;C1561542;C1561542;C1561542;C0015726;C0018792;C0015726;C3534109;C3534109;C4331837;C4331837;C0085632;C3843322;C0013453;C3845941;C0031809;C3272565;C0868996;C0026649;C0031809;C4086490;C4086490;C0427198;C1525443;C1525443,C0034991;C0038454,20070301,,,Completed,20185616,24,24.0,0.0027155659745250003,0.0033901806262459995

Current guidelines in western countries recommend an tPA dose of      0.9mg/kg up to a maximum dose of 90mg for patients weighing more than 100kg. However, larger      dose-finding rtPA trials for intravenous thrombolysis in AIS are missing. Based on results      from research on myocardial infarction only a few open label studies with low case rates were      initiated to evaluate the optimal dose for tPA in cerebral ischemia. These studies suggested      a narrow therapeutic range with decreased efficacy in lower dosages and an increased risk for      thrombolysis related intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) at doses above 0.95mg/kg. The ECASS-1      trial which used a dosage of 1.1mg/kg rt-PA showed significantly higher rate of large      parenchymal hemorrhages compared to trials using 0.9mg/kg. Therefore accurate dosing is      crucial. In the acute phase two aspects complicate rtPA dosing in AIS: First, unlike in other      diseases many stroke patients are unable to communicate information on their body weight (BW)      because of their stroke symptoms (e.g. aphasia, decreased consciousness). In addition motor      symptoms prohibit easy weighing procedures in many patients. Second, the ultra-early and      narrow time window for treatment does not allow time loss to weigh each patient in the      emergency situation. Therefore routinely the attending physician has to make a visual      estimation of the patient's BW. This may be inaccurate and may cause dosing errors which has      been shown for other weight based emergency medication. There is little data on tPA-dosing      errors in stroke patients and prospective data are lacking. The aim of our study is to      evaluate availability of BW-information, accuracy of estimations and final dosing of tPA in a      routine clinical setting. Therefore the investigators evaluate different sources of body      weight estimations and also compare visual estimation with recently proposed anthropometric      measurements for body weight approximation. Finally, impact of dosing errors on safety and      efficacy are analyzed.      The initial phase will consist of 100 enrolled patients as a pilot phase for further power      calculations. Based on the results of the pilot phase enrollment will continue.

Further, these treatments are very intense, with total treatment      times as high as 30 to 60 hours, making them clinically or economically unfeasible in many      settings. In contrast, approaches incorporating cognitive strategy training have shown great      promise to not only improve functional activity performance in people living with stroke, but      also to facilitate generalization and transfer beyond the clinical setting, and to do so in      10 to 15 treatment hours. Cognitive Orientation to daily Occupational Performance (CO-OP) is      an established treatment approach that uses cognitive strategies in combination with TST.      Evidence from other research groups and findings from our own participant interview data      indicate that the approach may be even more effective if introduced much earlier in the      rehabilitation process, however, CO-OP has not yet been tested in this sub-acute population.      Therefore, the specific project goals are: 1. To refine the CO-OP treatment approach for use      with people less than three months post stroke; 2.

We      hypothesize that a significant barrier is the difficulty in weighing the benefits and risks      of rt-PA treatment in the care of an individual patient, a problem compounded by the time      urgency of decision-making and clinical fears that weigh risks of treatment more heavily than      benefits.

Through an      earlier project, we will have programmed ePRISM with the best available risk-stratification      models and developed a clinically useful format for presenting the data to support clinical      decision-making in AIS.

Recent innovations in stroke therapy have applied motor learning      principles to improve motor skills through regular practice of activities using the weaker      limb. Because the ankle provides critical torques for normal walking and mobility function,      impairments at the affected ankle pose a major limitation to achieving optimal mobility      recovery. To address this we have developed a novel ankle robot (Anklebot) to enhance      physical therapy for improving walking and mobility after stroke. This computer controlled      device provides assistance when users cannot complete a movement, but will not assist if the      user is active.      Motor learning requires active involvement in task-related practice to mediate brain      plasticity. While voluntary movement is important to remodel motor control circuits, the      brain mechanisms of reward and motivation also can play an important role. Core brain      networks involved in reward and motivation increase a person's involvement with their      surroundings, to focus attention and to prompt one to approach reward and avoid punishment.      This increased involvement and the elevated emotions associated with it have been shown to      enhance performance, memory and learning.      The purpose of this study is to investigate responses of brain and motor behavior of stroke      patients who use the Anklebot during a 3-week / 3-session/week motor learning based training.      These responses are compared to a 3-week delayed entry period in which the participants will      perform an at-home walking program of equal time. After the 3-week delayed entry walking      program, subjects are divided into low and high reward-feedback groups. The low      reward-feedback group receives the Anklebot training with only immediate feedback on target      successes, without cumulative scores and with minimal social interaction with the      researchers. The high-reward group receives cumulative scores and ongoing social support, are      eligible for prizes during each session and at the study's completion. All subjects play the      games as noninvasive electroencephalography and electromyography record brain and muscle      activity. In addition to analyzing brain information before and after the Anklebot training,      ankle motor control and walking functions are also assessed immediately before and after the      first and last robotic training sessions.",EEG;Robotics (ankle);Motor-learning;Brain Plasticity;,Nervous System Diseases;Cardiovascular Diseases;,C0001613;C1554161;C0038454;C0003086,C0001613;C1554161;C0038454;C0003086,C0013819;C0037420;C0700572;C0949766;C0013839;C0589098;C0872085;C4085668;C0427068;C0026612;C0026605;C0026605;C1697779;C0023185;C0237607;C0425245;C0031843;C0425245;C0425245;C0023185;C0237607;C0013987;C0023185;C0023185;C0033213;C1442065;C0038454;C1553386;C0038454;C0557034;C0035397;C0035397;C0035397;C0025260;C0038454;C0025344;C0035397;C1552839;C0035397;C0035397;C0034869;C0003086;C0003086;C0679622;C0003086;C0006104;C0006104;C0006104;C0947630;C0006104;C0947630;C0006104;C0006104;C0003086;C0015385;C0600138;C1704326;C1706352;C1561540;C0600138;C1550472;C1550472;C0427086;C0684336;C1280910;C0581668;C1704632;C1704632;C0031843;C0442694;C0442694;C0442694;C0442694;C2004454;C0184511;C3242430;C0233492;C1320102;C1320102;C1697779;C2911690;C1831583;C2363670;C4084912;C4084912;C0856882;C0233697;C1552839;C1552839;C3845941;C1555587;C1547298;C1555587;C4283785;C0026649;C3245501;C2911691;C2911691;C2911691;C4049938;C1697779;C3849973;C0233697;C0151576;C2945638,C0038454,C0027868;C0553692;C0454578;C0949766;C0518895;C0150055;C1883654;C0424927;C1883653;C0424927;C0031843;C3272565;C3858758;C0700287;C0549206;C0392366;C0262512;C0392366;C0205082;C0205082;C0003086;C0003086;C0016928;C0016928;C1551994;C1136201;C0332516;C4283785;C0442694;C0442694;C0442694;C0442036;C0009797;C1561542;C4331837;C3534109;C3534109;C3534109;C0022116;C0033348;C0026649;C4699190;C1525443;C3843408,C1831583,20140901,8.0,135.0,Completed,24933720,12,12.0,0.0028782308816959995,0.0032278798914080003

Patients      patients fail to be aware of objects or people to their left and orientate instead to their      right side. Enduring neglect has been found to be a poor prognostic indicator for functional      independence following stroke. Despite some promising experimental accounts there are no      established treatments for this condition.      The aim of this study is to test whether a combined treatment with hemifield eye patching      (HEP) and optokinetic stimulation (OKS) can permanently reduce neglect behaviour and improve      functional outcome in patients with hemispatial neglect following stroke.      The investigators hypothesise that the treatment with HEP and OKS will lead to a greater      reduction of neglect scoring in the neglect test battery as well as a greater improvement in      functional independence scores as compared to the spontaneous clinical course of the      usual-care control group.,,"Nervous System Diseases;Cardiovascular Diseases;Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;",C0751421;C0441615;C0038454;C0947630;C0015392;C1550655;C1292856,C1096777;C0751421;C0441615;C0038454;C0947630;C0015392;C1550655;C1292856,C0009241;C0751421;C0009429;C0776981;C1292856;C0220901;C0087111;C0021212;C0012634;C0087111;C4551656;C0521874;C0521874;C0521874;C0521874;C0521874;C0542351;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0947630;C0392366;C1442948;C0392366;C0439857;C0439857;C0424013;C0677505;C4554468;C1550655;C0184511;C3844714;C0031843;C0031843;C0031843;C0015726;C1552839,C0012634,C0524851;C0521874;C0521874;C0542351;C0221198;C0038454;C0038454;C0392366;C0392366;C1114365;C0009797;C4082977;C1519316,C1140111,20140201,,,Completed,24923723,3,3.0,0.0030776065173890007,0.0032077106971879995

These studies have shown for the first time      a major decrease (-35%) of disability related to severe cerebral infarction and reduction in      mortality. These studies only used thrombectomy devices called stent retriever for obtaining      recanalization rates ranging from 58-72% for the 2 largest studies (MR CLEAN, ESCAPE 2014,      2015). This criterion ""recanalization"" is important because it largely determines the      functional prognosis of patients with severe cerebral infarction (Khatri, 2014).      These results are exciting but we can do even better. Indeed, already new thrombectomy      devices are available with a special interest for ADAPT (A Direct Aspiration First Pass      Technic). This distal suction system, with a high level of endovascular navigability,      provides high recanalization rates (> 90%), low morbidity, with a synergistic effect with      stent retriever (Turk A, Kowoll 2014 and 2015). To date, these technic (ADAPT) has never been      assessed in a randomized controlled trial.      We have previously conducted a comparative observational study between two recanalization      strategies by thrombectomy using first-line ADAPT or the most widely used stent retriever.      The interventional neuroradiologist could, in case of recanalization failure with the      Solitaire system, used another thrombectomy material left to the operator's choice. 244      consecutive patients on two centers (Rothschild Foundation, and Foch Hospital, France)      admitted for a cerebral infarction associated with proximal occlusion were included. This is      so far the largest series of patients with ADAPT system. The complete recanalization rate was      84% with ADAPT versus 68% with stent retriever (P = 0.006). Unpublished data, Oral      presentation at the European Stroke Organization, April 2015). Our research aims to show that      a first line strategy of recanalization by thrombectomy using a distal suction system (ADAPT)      is superior that the use of a stent retriever.",,"Cardiovascular Diseases;Nervous System Diseases;Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;",C0162578;C0220787;C0543488;C1552596;C0005847;C0038454;C1547229;C2828386;C0581603;C0028778,C1140111,C0282440;C0282440;C4534538;C0007785;C0007785;C0007785;C0007785;C0596298;C0034771;C0034771;C0034771;C0034771;C0034771;C0034771;C0034771;C0162578;C0162578;C0524425;C0162578;C0162578;C1552679;C0162578;C0231170;C0220787;C0679199;C1514811;C0087111;C4551656;C0033325;C0220880;C0028778;C0543488;C0184666;C0679199;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0038638;C0038638;C0870509;C0205082;C0870509;C0205082;C1552596;C1518681;C0038454;C0038257;C0038257;C0947630;C0038257;C0038257;C0038257;C1273517;C2828386;C1273517;C1273517;C3245479;C1578513;C1550472;C0442797;C0184661;C1964257;C0233492;C0233256;C0031843;C4084912;C0729829;C0729829;C4489236;C1555587;C1705273;C4489236;C4283785;C0701928,C0021308,C0007785;C0007785;C0021682;C0007430;C0007272;C0006147;C0520997;C0162578;C0162578;C0162578;C0005775;C0005775;C0002978;C0002978;C0566001;C0005775;C0231519;C0231519;C0043143;C0184661;C0741453;C0032961;C4684790;C0150312;C1550655;C0020517;C1550655;C1550655;C0700164;C0038454;C0947630;C1306645;C0175659;C1114365;C1561538;C1457887;C0699794;C1545588;C0085297;C0028778;C0751438;C0028778;C0027627;C0449900;C3534109;C4331837;C0973449;C0751437;C0751437;C0027530,C1140111,20170201,,,Completed,30425161;29760012;28763550;28428348,18,4.5,0.002494689406122,0.003207553751145

Children 6-18 years with imaging-confirmed      perinatal stroke and functional motor impairment will be recruited. Children will be      randomized (1:1) to receive sham or tDCS (20 minutes daily) during daily intensive,      goal-directed motor learning therapy (90 minutes). Motor outcomes will be repeated at      baseline, 1 week, and 2 months.      Aim 1: Establish the ability of tDCS to safely enhance motor learning in children with      perinatal stroke.      Hypothesis 1: tDCS is safe and well tolerated in children.      Hypothesis 2: Contralesional, cathodal tDCS increases motor functional gains measured by AHA      at 2 months in children with perinatal stroke.",perinatal stroke;hemiparetic cerebral palsy;brain stimulation;tDCS;constraint-induced movement therapy;hand arm bimanual intensive therapy;,Nervous System Diseases;Cardiovascular Diseases;,C0038454;C3850024;C1831583,C3850024;C0678723;C0038454;C1831583,C0870227;C1292856;C0018989;C0684336;C0750484;C0031843;C0023185;C0023185;C0079595;C0087111;C3244286;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0947630;C0392366;C3850024;C3850024;C0018017;C1561540;C3850024;C3850024;C3850024;C2948600;C0050451;C0184511;C0562230;C0031843;C4699604;C4699604;C1714809;C1334278;C4522152;C0728774;C0886384;C4082977,C0522224,C0027765;C0424605;C0870227;C1301624;C1263853;C2599718;C0018989;C1140999;C0026838;C0013227;C0030971;C0750484;C3272565;C0443343;C0014544;C0542560;C0542560;C0036572;C0543467;C0087111;C0087111;C0038454;C0024763;C0718247;C0016129;C0038454;C0038454;C0205082;C0205082;C0205082;C0725694;C3244287;C0043262;C1706074;C0220843;C0005615;C1546725;C0175659;C1561542;C0700702;C0181620;C0233324;C0018563;C0015385;C1550557;C1550557;C0446516;C0436548;C3843228;C1136201;C0587599;C4699604;C0475455;C0233492;C1525442;C1525442;C3543419;C0021102;C1561542;C1561542;C0275586;C0231221;C2827624;C1334278,C0006104;C0087111;C0446516;C0454279,20150401,,,Completed,27927938,11,11.0,0.0031216244750149995,0.0031999543963380003

Participants will also be      assisted by a physiotherapist to walk in a more normal manner.      Participants' will be assessed at the beginning of the study, after the 5 week training      program and again, eight weeks later. The research assistant will assess their ability to      walk, their confidence level and the average daily walking activity.      Primary Hypothesis: Individuals assigned to the Motor Learning Walking Program will improve      their walking ability from baseline to follow up assessment significantly more than      individuals assigned to the Treadmill Training Program.      The results of this study will help physiotherapists plan effective treatment programs for      individuals with walking difficulties following stroke. It will also give researchers      direction for future studies in the areas of walking retraining and motor skill development      post-stroke.",Stroke;Walking;Motor learning;Skill acquisition;,Nervous System Diseases;Cardiovascular Diseases;,C1273869;C1554161;C4283795;C0262926;C0038454;C0882214;C0038999,C1096777;C0023185;C1554161;C4283795;C0376691;C0944911;C0038454;C1551342;C1171411;C0038999,C0311394;C0033211;C1299586;C1305866;C0026612;C0243107;C0231170;C0237529;C0031809;C0087111;C1552601;C0237607;C1552601;C0023185;C1552601;C1554161;C4283795;C0376691;C0376691;C0947630;C0038454;C0038454;C1518681;C0038454;C0038454;C1553386;C0038454;C0038454;C0947630;C0947630;C0023185;C0947630;C0947630;C1561540;C1561540;C1552861;C0442694;C0442694;C0184511;C1320102;C0233697;C0949766;C0870365;C0042070;C0237607;C4049938;C0728774;C0042070;C0701928,C0038454,C0741183;C0085096;C0027051;C0034074;C4282165;C0003811;C0029354;C0243026;C0155686;C0271215;C0002965;C0023216;C0023216;C0234469;C0085086;C0442816;C0741923;C0018801;C0031046;C0020538;C0311395;C0557834;C1299583;C0557834;C0278140;C1561560;C1301725;C0002688;C0175649;C0424927;C0024109;C0741585;C0220929;C2346845;C0022116;C4283795;C0038454;C0038454;C1299582;C0205082;C0205082;C0205082;C0205082;C0947630;C0002658;C1547229;C1547229;C0015967;C0392366;C1114365;C0231221;C1280910;C0012634;C4699604;C0452240;C1457887;C3843698;C2328206;C0723443;C0451227;C0804815;C0012000;C3694424;C1561542;C4331837;C1995642;C3245501;C3834249,,20110601,,,Completed,22018267,2,2.0,0.0026816790754379998,0.003150867360493

SUMMARY:      The best treatment for prevention of another stroke or TIA in patients with narrowing of one      of the arteries in the brain is uncertain. A common treatment is the use of anti-clotting      medications to prevent blood clots from forming in the narrowed vessel. There are a variety      of medicines used for this purpose. These medications are usually taken for the rest of a      patient's life.      However, a treatment that has been used successfully together with anti-clotting medications      in patients with narrowing of the blood vessels of the heart is now being studied in the      blood vessels of the brain. This treatment is called stenting.      Recent research has also indicated a benefit in prevention of recurring stroke by Intensive      Medical Therapy, which is defined as treating risk factors for stroke like high blood      pressure, elevated LDL (low density lipids - the ""bad"" form of cholesterol) and diabetes. The      purpose of this study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of either Intensive Medical      Therapy PLUS Stenting or Intensive Medical Therapy ONLY in preventing stroke, heart attacks      or death.      The study will enroll patients over a 5 year period. Each participant will be involved in the      study for a minimum of 1 year and a maximum of 3 years.      Fifty different medical centers in the United States are part of this study.

Pilot studies with stroke patients indicate that the application of Nintendo      Wii® (WII) is practicable and can improve balance under clinical conditions. However, larger      trials are necessary to verify these positive effects after discharge from the hospital.      AIM: This study aims to prepare and optimize a phase III trial which compares the effects of      two HBE programs for stroke patients.      METHODS: A pilot study with randomized control design and repeated measures over three-months      will be conducted. Twenty elderly stroke patients will be randomly allocated to an      experimental group (EG) and a control group (CG). All participants will receive an      introduction to a HBE program by an individual mentoring over 6 weeks. During the following 6      weeks the participants perform the HBE on their own.

The MISTT      study will test the effect of two complementary interventions against usual care. The two      interventions include: a) Stroke Case Managers (SCMs) who are trained social workers, and b)      an online informational website or portal. The 12 week intervention period begins when the      stroke patient returns home from the hospital or rehab facility. The SCMs will conduct at      least 2 home visits with the patient (one within 3-4 days and one around 30 days) along with      weekly follow-up telephone calls. Supplemental home visits will be used as necessary over the      12 week period. At the first home visit the social workers will conduct a comprehensive      in-home assessment and link patients and caregivers to local resources as necessary. Patients      also assigned to the website will have access to a patient-centered online information and      support resource called the Virtual Stroke Support Portal (VSSP). The investigators      hypothesize that this personalized case management program will reduce patient and caregiver      needs, improve quality of life, and decrease caregiver stress.

Blood      pressure control is considered the most important contributor to positive health outcomes in      stroke patients. The measurement of central blood pressure (cSBP) (the blood pressure which      is being exerted at the heart), may provide clinicians with important diagnostic and      prognostic information over and above that typically obtained from a peripheral blood      pressure measure (the blood pressure in the arm). Central blood pressures may be better than      traditional peripheral blood pressure measures as: i) peripheral blood pressure may not      accurately reflect the effects of peak arterial blood pressure on centrally located organs,      ii) central blood pressures may be 50 % superior to peripheral blood pressures when      predicting cardiovascular events, and iii) information pertaining to central blood pressures      may be more effective in the management of hypertension. While the validity of oscillometric      devices which measure central blood pressures has been demonstrated, further study is      required to determine precision under normal clinical operating conditions (i.e., reflective      of the Hospital/GP practice setting). As such, this study will assess central and peripheral      blood pressures of stroke patients when fasted and nonfasted, and when seated and supine. The      study is interested in identifying the effect of the above parameters (fasted vs. unfasted,      seated vs. supine) on central and peripheral blood pressures in stroke patients.      Participants will take part in three separate assessment sessions, on three separate days,      with a minimum 24 hour recovery between each session. Each assessment is expected to last 90      minutes, with a minimum of eight blood pressures being taken from the left upper arm. As      such, participants will be asked to give up 4.5 hours of their time to the study. During each      assessment participants will be tested in a fasted and non-fasted state, and in a supine      (lying) and seated position. All assessments will take place between 7 and 10am and will be      undertaken following written informed consent.",Central blood pressure;Transient ischaemic attack;,Nervous System Diseases;Cardiovascular Diseases;,C0229664;C0460139;C0038454;C1879652,C0229664;C0460139;C0722716;C0015663;C0038454;C1550655;C1879652,C0007787;C1272641;C1320716;C0229664;C0229664;C0229664;C0229664;C0229664;C0005823;C0005823;C0005823;C0005823;C0005823;C0005823;C0005823;C0005823;C0005823;C0230347;C0027051;C0020538;C0015663;C1261322;C0237607;C0220901;C0376636;C0543488;C0031809;C0031809;C0031809;C0027627;C0460139;C0460139;C0005847;C0460139;C1446409;C0460139;C0460139;C0460139;C3245501;C0237607;C0015264;C0558058;C0542559;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0178784;C1553386;C0038454;C1518681;C0038454;C0392366;C0005767;C0018787;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0446516;C1550470;C0012634;C0086972;C0086972;C2004454;C1555587;C0009797;C3242430;C3242430;C1518681;C0011900;C1881145;C0029375;C0202165;C4084912;C4084912;C0233697;C4055646;C0231519;C4699372;C4697740;C3272565;C1879652;C0233697;C0886384;C4082977,C0038454,C4048182;C0439857;C0031809;C0011900;C0011900;C0011900;C0443343;C0011265;C0018787;C1550655;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0030054;C0038454;C0038454;C0947630;C0012634;C1550655;C1550655;C4331837;C3272565,C1304680;C0005767;C0022116;C1879652,20170701,,,Completed,30383781,1,1.0,0.002668483996819,0.0031155641196390004

Although stroke      incidence and mortality decline steadily in Taiwan, its impact on medical cost, quality of      life and neurological deficits remains extraordinary. Stroke incidence and mortality are also      rising in the developed countries presumably due to a world-wide increase in prevalence of      obesity and metabolic syndrome. Negative associations have been observed between high blood      pressure, hyperglycemia and two major dietary cations in vegetables and dairy products:      potassium and magnesium. Mean levels of dietary potassium and magnesium intake in Taiwan are      much lower than those of dietary reference intake. Short term supplementation studies have      demonstrated their effects in reducing blood pressure and degree of insulin resistance.      However, long-term studies on cardiovascular events are lacking. Our previous long-term      intervention trial in elderly veteran home showed a 41% reduction in cardiovascular mortality      by simply switching regular cooking salt to potassium-enriched salt in kitchens. The      investigators have previously observed an annual reduction of medical cost around $ 15,000 NT      in the aforementioned veteran home trial.

Telerehabilitation allows      patients to train in their own home which also allows for longer training periods than what      is currently allowed clinically. Noninvasive transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)      uses two surface electrodes connected to a small battery that will be attached to the head.      This will be used to modulate neuronal excitability. With sensors attached to fingers and the      wrist, the patient will move the joints to track a target displayed on a screen. The combined      treatment will be applied in two experiments. The first will be on 3 patients coming to our      lab and the second on 3 patients in their home, both under supervision. We will integrate the      two components and test the resulting and novel treatment system for technical feasibility      and safety, which will set the stage for future efficacy studies under federal grant support.

Currently, systemic thrombolysis with the tissue plasminogen activator represents the only      causal and approved treatment for acute ischemic stroke. However, the chances to save the      brain tissue by a thrombolytic therapy exponentially decrease with proceeding time after      onset of symptoms.      In most cases, the beginning of the thrombolysis therapy is delayed by a variety of factors,      like delivery to the hospital, re-examinations and delay of blood analysis or of CT scans.

Deficits in dual-tasking      may severely compromise the ability to participate fully in community living. Unfortunately,      current rehabilitation practice for stroke fails to adequately address dual-task limitations;      individuals with stroke continue to exhibit clinically significant dual-task costs on gait at      discharge. As a result, many stroke survivors are living in the community with residual      deficits that may increase disability in the real world and lead to falls with devastating      consequences. To address this issue, the proposed study investigates the efficacy of      dual-task gait training on attention allocation and locomotor performance in      community-dwelling stroke survivors. Because walking in the real world often requires      time-critical tasks and obstacle avoidance, the investigators will test the impact of      dual-task gait training on cognitive-motor interference during walking at preferred speed and      at maximal speed (Aim 1), and on locomotor control during obstacle negotiation (Aim 2). The      investigators will also evaluate the effects of the intervention on community reintegration      and participation (Aim 3).",Gait;Dual-task;Obstacle avoidance;Attention allocation;,Nervous System Diseases;Cardiovascular Diseases;,C1554161;C4283795;C0038454;C1554184,C1554161;C4283795;C0038454;C1554184;C0004268;C1564718,C0034991;C0085673;C0085673;C0184661;C0945826;C2945640;C0231170;C0012621;C0004268;C0870186;C0205082;C0237607;C1442065;C0015272;C1442065;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0085639;C0947630;C0002658;C0002658;C0016928;C1442948;C0392366;C2948600;C2948600;C2948600;C1518681;C0870921;C1555588;C3694424;C1547928;C3245501;C1547298;C0220825;C0939261;C0056170;C0151576,C0038454,C3496286;C0027765;C0876926;C0030567;C0023015;C0026769;C1384666;C0029354;C3665347;C0023216;C1096775;C0521654;C0020538;C0002688;C0009240;C0011265;C4283795;C0038454;C0595998;C1554187;C0595998;C0038454;C0038454;C0205082;C0037817;C0002658;C0947630;C0392366;C0392366;C0016928;C1280910;C0658994;C4082977;C4684637;C0804815;C1706074;C3534109;C4331837;C0199168;C3172260;C4539575;C3845379,C1555588,20171115,,,Completed,23113928,6,6.0,0.0029394549620440002,0.003007348854883

Nitric oxide      donors are effective in experimental stroke and pilot studies in patients suggest that one,      glyceryl trinitrate, can be delivered easily in a transdermal preparation. Around half of all      patients admitted with acute stroke are taking antihypertensive therapy immediately prior to      their stroke. No data exist as to whether it is beneficial or safe to stop or continue this      treatment during the acute phase. ENOS is a prospective, international, multicentre,      randomised, parallel-group, blinded, controlled, collaborative, factorial trial designed to      test two questions related to the management of blood pressure immediately post-stroke:        1. The safety and efficacy of nitric oxide, given as transdermal glyceryl trinitrate.        2. The safety and efficacy of stopping or continuing prior antihypertensive medication.      Previously independent adult patients who are conscious and have residual limb weakness are      eligible for enrollment. Central randomisation will be performed via the internet. Treatment      is initiated within 48 hours of stroke onset and is given as daily glyceryl trinitrate      patches for 7 days. A computed tomography (CT) scan is required within 7 days of      randomisation. Early follow-up is performed locally over the 7 days of treatment, including      blood pressure, early stroke events, and adverse events. Telephone central follow-up by the      trial co-ordinating centre will be performed at 3 months.

However, drug treatment only succeed in restoring      blood flow in a minority of people with clots in the larger arteries (10-25% depending on the      size of the blood vessel) and these people also have the most severe strokes and highest risk      of death or dependence as a result of the stroke. Current best treatment is therefore least      effective in the group with the most severe strokes. Devices that can be fed through the      blood vessels to either remove or break up the blood clot in the brain vessels can open this      type of large artery blockage. However, using these devices is a highly skilled procedure and      it takes some time both to set up the necessary facilities (including anaesthetic, nurses and      medical support) and to reach the blockage. The extra time that is required to use these      devices may mean that brain tissue is already irreversibly damaged. If so, then an individual      patient cannot benefit and indeed may be harmed by opening the artery. There are no completed      clinical trials comparing the outcome in people treated with standard stroke treatment and      those treated with devices. PISTE is a randomised, controlled trial to test whether      additional mechanical thrombectomy device treatment improves functional outcome in patients      with large artery occlusion who are given IV thrombolytic drug treatment as standard care.",,"Nervous System Diseases;Cardiovascular Diseases;Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;",C0162578;C0220825;C0038454,C0936233;C0162578;C0520997;C0524466;C2825951;C0038454;C0005847;C1547229;C1550655;C0085297;C0028778,C0016018;C0264995;C1096775;C0005847;C0016018;C0678861;C0005847;C0226003;C0162578;C0087086;C0232338;C0439857;C0087086;C0087111;C0087111;C0184661;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0003842;C3245501;C2828392;C2828392;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0005847;C0003842;C0010957;C0038454;C0205082;C0038454;C0205082;C0003842;C0038454;C0006104;C0013227;C0302148;C0011065;C0006104;C0006104;C3244317;C0302148;C0013227;C0392366;C0036849;C0002932;C0439857;C2004454;C0025080;C0010957;C0849759;C2911690;C0031843;C1552839;C1101725;C1328018;C0018792;C1706968;C1706968;C1706968;C0184511;C0332155;C0332155;C0332155;C3843352;C0151576,C0021308,C0151699;C0038525;C0149566;C0521654;C0948008;C0741978;C0007282;C0264995;C0007430;C0007430;C0085605;C0184661;C0743860;C0009488;C3845888;C0524466;C0524425;C0524466;C0005779;C0184906;C0003489;C1299583;C1273518;C0162791;C0006826;C0011900;C0087111;C0184661;C0087111;C0332218;C0028778;C0677042;C3272565;C2828392;C0034117;C0332149;C0034117;C0011209;C0085590;C1517001;C3272565;C0005847;C0005847;C0006104;C1457887;C2923685;C0262512;C0543467;C0199168;C0018787;C0038454;C0087136;C0038454;C0038454;C1553386;C0332148;C0005847;C0205082;C0018246;C1552850;C0018246;C0460005;C0022646;C1299581;C1299581;C0243032;C3854213;C1578513;C1301624;C1457887;C4269149;C3272565;C0332149;C1328685;C0028778;C4055646;C0449900;C1561542;C1561542;C4331837;C1714809;C4697740;C4489236;C4489236,C1140111,20150701,,,Terminated,27756804;24298176,19,9.5,0.0031914461666479998,0.0029775364969540003

Impaired force level control is a      major deficit of motor control in people with stroke. Electromyographic biofeedback (EMG      biofeedback) has been suggested by researchers and clinicians to be a useful and effective      tool for enhancing control of force level during motor skill learning for people with stroke.      Based on the concept of motor-skill learning, practice with variable force levels may be more      effective than practice with a constant force level to enhance movement performance. The EMG      biofeedback provides a suitable tool for such practice of force level control and hence for      motor skill learning. However, research literatures thus far have yet to provide convincing      evidences to support this claim. Neural imaging studies have shown corresponding brain      reorganization and neural plasticity following physical practice of movement skills in people      with stroke. It is curious whether EMG biofeedback augmented physical practice of motor      skills enhances brain reorganization. Using brain mapping techniques, in particular, the      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), we could investigate neural plasticity accompanying      motor function changes induced by physical training, and hence may help to develop safer and      more effective training parameters. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of      variable practiced EMG biofeedback training emphasized on force level control of the ankle      muscle on balance and gait performance and the corresponding changes of corticospinal      excitability using TMS in people with chronic stroke.",stroke;transcranial magnetic stimulation;EMG biofeedback;motor function;neural plasticity;force;,Nervous System Diseases;Cardiovascular Diseases;,C1096775;C0026650;C0005491;C0038454;C0016533;C1564718,C0436548;C0005491;C1554161;C1710422;C0038454;C2946261;C1705273;C0235169;C0016533;C1564718,C0436548;C0871664;C0871370;C0871370;C0871370;C0006117;C0235169;C0005491;C0005491;C0005491;C0005491;C0237607;C0237607;C0237607;C0237607;C0237607;C0031843;C0079595;C0947630;C0014653;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0006104;C0006104;C0947630;C0003086;C1552861;C0016928;C0436548;C0436548;C0023866;C1550470;C0237607;C0442694;C0442694;C1555587;C0000589;C0013839;C0011164;C1518681;C1831583;C1831583;C4084912;C0016533;C0016533;C0016533;C0016533;C0016533;C0016533;C0016533;C0016533;C0026649;C4553760;C0026649;C1555587;C0031809;C0026649;C0031809;C0031809;C4553760;C2363670,C0038454,C0086511;C0242422;C0018989;C1290940;C1290940;C0018991;C0030163;C0014544;C0262512;C0038454;C0441074;C0003086;C0030193;C0018670;C0019552;C4300452;C1561542;C1522411;C0026649,C0436548,20140701,,,Unknown status,30598705,0,0.0,0.002448045849942,0.002932715419205

The benefit of PROMS is that they gather information from the      patient's perspective, which offers great potential to improve the quality and outcomes of      health services (Department of Health 2011).      There is a PROM (the PROMIS-10 Global Health) and a number of extra questions that are      recommended for use in people who have had a stroke by the International Consortium for      Health Outcomes Measurement, but the best way of delivering these questions for stroke      survivors is unknown.      At present, the NHS in England, Scotland and Wales are required to offer every stroke      survivors a 6 month post stroke follow-up appointment. Currently, the information collected      at the 6 month review is not from the patient's perspective and the best method of collecting      this information has not been established. The Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme      (SSNAP) which is led by the Royal College of Physicians in London promote the 6 month      follow-up assessment. SSNAP recognise that currently 4 different methods of 6 month follow-up      appointment occur. The current methods in use are face-to-face assessment, telephone      interview, online questionnaire or postal questionnaire.      The aim of this research is to understand if there is a difference between these 4 methods of      delivering these questions in people who have had a stroke.      As part of the 6 month review this research study will assess the response rate for 15      Patient Reported Health Status questions across the 4 recognised methods of delivery;        -  Face-to-Face        -  Telephone        -  Online        -  Post      To conduct this research study a sample of 808 stroke survivors will be asked to take part in      the research. From these 808 people, 202 participants will be randomly assigned to each      method of administration (Face-to-Face Interview, Telephone Interview, Postal Questionnaire      and Online Questionnaire).      The questionnaires received by the research team will not record any personally identifiable      information. The data will then be utilised by the researchers for statistical analysis in      order to identify, which method of the 4 methods of administration, under investigation, is      the most acceptable for stroke survivors. The conclusions of this research will inform the      roll-out of the most appropriate method of delivering the 6 month stroke follow-up review for      stroke survivors.",PROM;Patient Reported Outcome Measure;PROMIS;PROMIS-10;PROMIS Global Health;RiksStroke;ICHOM;International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement;Wales;Administration;Method;Delivery;,"Nervous System Diseases;Cardiovascular Diseases;Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;",C1533734;C0031809;C0684224;C1550655;C0025663;C0038454;C1522634;C1328956;C0723443,C1533734;C1533734;C0031809;C2911690;C0684224;C1704632;C0684224;C1550655;C0025663;C0025663;C1550655;C0038454;C0038454;C0947630;C1522634;C1522634;C1328956;C0723443;C1328956;C0723443,C2987124;C0518214;C0018747;C1550208;C1533734;C0034394;C1533734;C0034394;C0034394;C0034394;C0034394;C0034394;C1552578;C0086388;C0031809;C0031809;C0162340;C0935630;C1515258;C0935630;C1515258;C0935630;C3245501;C1704632;C0684224;C0011209;C1552601;C1556133;C0150312;C0025663;C0025663;C0025663;C1550655;C0025663;C0025663;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0282443;C0025663;C0038454;C0038454;C0282443;C0038454;C0025663;C0034869;C0025663;C0038454;C0700287;C0025663;C0038454;C0282443;C0038454;C1561542;C1561542;C3853835;C1561542;C1561542;C1561542;C0947630;C0947630;C1561542;C0015450;C0015450;C0015450;C0015450;C0015450;C0015450;C3245479;C0804815;C0184511;C3242430;C3843236;C3242430;C3242430;C3242430;C0085632;C1328956;C1328956;C1328956;C0723443;C0441621;C3889277;C0870427;C0870427;C1515258;C3858576;C1328018;C1101725;C1522411;C0376691;C4086490;C4086490,C0019080;C0007785,C0019080;C0021308;C0750484;C0011900;C0011900;C0011900;C0011900;C1550450;C0011900;C0228174;C0021308;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0870733;C0870733;C0870733;C0870733;C1550655;C0019080;C0019080;C4048188;C3272565;C1561542;C1561542;C0003707,C1550208;C0684224,20180401,,,Completed,29970156,0,0.0,0.002913940707265,0.002911346244095

The diagnosis of AF after cerebral ischemia is difficult to establish even      during the treatment at specialised stroke units, as paroxysmal episodes may terminate      spontaneously before arrival at the hospital and do not always show early recurrence.      However, the diagnosis of AF is of particular clinical relevance since adaequate      anticoagulation is one of the most effective secondary preventive treatments in stroke. The      detection rate of AF after stroke increases progressively by extending the duration and      intensity of cardiac monitoring. For this purpose innovative medical devices and implantable      event recorders have been suggested. However, high socioeconomic expenses, malcompliance and      the invasiveness of some of these approaches currently limit their use to a minority of      affected patients, while the growing number of stroke survivors is lacking access to free and      simple screening tools.      For primary prevention, the measurement of the peripheral pulse (MPP) is currently the only      guideline-recommended screening method among individuals aged 65 years or older. In contrast,      MPP has never been applied in the setting of secondary stroke prevention, probably because      several factors were expected to interfere with this simple technique, including sensomotor      and neuropsychiologic handicaps of stroke patients 18. This study investigates feasibility      and validity of MPP in this cohort (pilot phase) and compares daily MPP for 6 months with      repeated holter-ECG in patients after ischemic stroke.",stroke;atrial fibrillation;secondary prevention of stroke;peripheral pulse measurement;,"Nervous System Diseases;Cardiovascular Diseases;Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;",C0004238;C0948008;C1511790;C0038454;C0034107;C0034107;C3843236,C0235480;C0948008;C0038454;C0034107;C0034107,C0004238;C0150496;C0033144;C0917798;C1277289;C0948008;C0003281;C0025080;C0948008;C1458156;C0087111;C0011900;C0332218;C0087111;C0011900;C0027627;C0182913;C0199230;C0282423;C0199230;C0027627;C0231172;C0332148;C0542559;C3245511;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0025663;C0038454;C0034107;C0947630;C3843802;C1553407;C0021102;C0723323;C0723323;C0202165;C1511790;C0332534;C0449900;C4055646;C1561542;C0015733;C3272565,C0232197,C0013516;C0004238;C0917798;C0150369;C0162340;C1301725;C0087111;C0262512;C1550655;C0600109;C0150312;C0016385;C1550655;C0038454;C0025663;C0038454;C0566415;C1547229;C0947630;C0023185;C0034107;C0034107;C1299581;C1551994;C1114365;C0184661;C0206077;C0011900;C0022885;C0202165;C4331837;C4283785;C3858758,C0199176;C0034107;C0202165,20151001,,,Unknown status,25804569,1,1.0,0.002500890690463,0.0027991352921120003

The incidence of chronic pain correlates      with increased age. Most of patients rely on analgesic medication to control the pain.      Dipyrone is an extensively used drug in Western and Eastern Europe as well as Central and      South America, largely due to its favorable analgesic and antipyretic effects in conjunction      with a low incidence of gastrointestinal complications when compared to other non-steroidal      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).      Aspirin is the backbone of antiplatelet therapy in patients after ischemic stroke. However,      it is known that there are substantial inter-individual response variabilities to      antiplatelet medication. Furthermore, patients with impaired response to aspirin have a      significant higher risk of recurrent cerebrovascular events. The investigators have recently      shown that co-medication with aspirin and dipyrone in patients with coronary artery disease      lead to insufficient antiplatelet effects of aspirin.      The incidence of chronic pain is very high in patients with ischemic stroke. Therefore, in      this study the investigators aim to examine, if co-medication of aspirin and dipyrone      interaction also occurs in patients after ischemic stroke.",ischemic stroke;Antiplatelet Effects;aspirin;metamizole;dipyrone;,Nervous System Diseases;Cardiovascular Diseases;,C0038454;C1550655,C0012586;C0004057;C0038454;C1550655,C0161819;C0280004;C0010054;C1096021;C0948008;C0948008;C0948008;C0150055;C0150055;C0150055;C0013227;C0013227;C0013227;C0013227;C0002771;C0442804;C0012586;C0037949;C1704632;C1704632;C0012586;C0012586;C0004057;C0004057;C0004057;C0004057;C0004057;C0683278;C0003211;C0013227;C0947630;C0030193;C1273517;C0013227;C1442948;C1550472;C0003209;C0000589;C1518681;C1518681;C3843761;C0038317;C1879652;C0151576,C0038454,C0036980;C0948008;C0013227;C0002771;C1114365;C1561538;C1550655;C0013227;C0376650,C0022116,20150201,,,Completed,27301652,1,1.0,0.005225878308439001,0.0027953215232670004

Normally older people      have a stroke, but also a significant number of younger people between 18 and 55 years.      Usually, these cannot be explained by the classical risk factors such as diabetes, overweight      and high blood pressure. New studies indicate that in about 1 - 2 % of the younger stroke      patients the cause could have been an undiagnosed genetic disease, the so called Fabry      disease. The purpose of this study is to determine in a large number of young stroke      patients, how many strokes were caused by Fabry Disease.","Cerebrovascular Accident;Cerebrovascular Accident, Acute;CVA (Cerebrovascular Accident);Cerebral Stroke;Stroke, Acute;Cerebrovascular Stroke;Fabry Disease;Anderson-Fabry Disease;Fabry's Disease;","Nervous System Diseases;Cardiovascular Diseases;Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases;Congenital, Hereditary, and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities1;",C0002986;C2347273;C0038454;C0038454;C1550655;C1550655,C0002986;C2347273;C0038454;C0038454;C1561557;C0947630;C1550655;C1550655,C0020538;C0019247;C0002986;C0035648;C0497406;C0011849;C3888388;C0947630;C0012634;C0038454;C0683278;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0947630;C1561538;C1408353;C4264416;C1555709;C4082977,C0012634,C0007787;C0007787;C0430022;C0751955;C0751955;C0948008;C0948008;C0948008;C0175636;C0175636;C1516879;C0019080;C0019080;C0019080;C0011900;C0184666;C0011900;C0184666;C1304680;C0038454;C0038454;C0947630;C0947630;C1547229;C0947630;C0947630;C0441633;C0441633;C0237607;C0022118;C1457887;C1550655;C0009797;C4684637;C0332534;C1561542;C1561542;C1561542;C0973449;C1555709;C3843322,C0012634;C0038454;C0038454;C0002986;C0038819,20100101,,,Completed,28754833;28619986;28088807;27899752;26566914;26227782;26038521;25899239;25659436;25380809;24607068;24186912;23748977;23468548;23306324;23150649;22723456;21196729,103,5.72222222222222,0.003221295820274,0.0027798298035740005

Current treatment with any antispasticity agent or previous injection with BOTOX","Patients who survive a stroke are often left with an arm that cannot be used. One reason for      this is that the muscles affected by the stroke become overactive. This is known as      spasticity. Such unwanted muscle overactivity, if left untreated or poorly managed, can lead      to limb deformities. For example, the wrist and fingers in the arm affected by spasticity      become stiff and curl into a fist and the hand cannot be used for any functional purpose.      Palm hygiene can become difficult and patients find this deformity unsightly and painful.      Botulinum toxin (BT) has been shown to reduce muscle overactivity and is licensed for this      purpose. In current practice this treatment is often used as a last line of defence. Although      BT can reduce the muscle overactivity, when injected using current protocols, it seems to      have little impact on the recovery of function and/or treating the limb deformities and pain.      If BT can be given in the early stages of a stroke, i.e. as soon as the muscle overactivity      is observed, then we will be able to treat spasticity and may prevent the limb deformities      and pain from developing. We may also be able to assist the recovery of arm movement in some      of the patients who would otherwise not have regained this. In addition to benefiting the      patient, the prevention of secondary complications by early treatment may reduce the costs of      long term care to the NHS . We hope to discover if our plan of providing early treatment with      BT is more effective than the current approach. If we demonstrate that the treatment is      effective we will be able to introduce this new method almost immediately within the NHS      through our collaboration with doctors and therapists who are actively treating patients with      this condition.",Early treatment of spasticity.;Post stroke spasticity.;,"Musculoskeletal Diseases;Nervous System Diseases;Cardiovascular Diseases;Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;",C0006055;C0026838;C0038454,C0006055;C0949766;C0026838;C0205161;C4049938;C1879367;C4083049;C1552651;C0446516;C3272565,C0599766;C0006055;C0023977;C0009566;C0474395;C0474395;C0474395;C0474395;C0026838;C0026838;C0026838;C0199176;C0332155;C0332218;C0087111;C0442711;C0027627;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0012634;C0237607;C0310255;C0016129;C0030193;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0557034;C0025663;C0043262;C3244317;C1273517;C1442948;C0015385;C0018563;C1273517;C0230373;C1273517;C0015385;C0030193;C1299581;C0015385;C0030193;C1299581;C0392347;C1299581;C0446516;C0446516;C0446516;C1578513;C0456642;C1550655;C2004454;C0730881;C1697779;C0031843;C0699530;C1300072;C1548573;C0026649;C0181622,,C0013786;C0022972;C0027765;C2937358;C0304925;C0026769;C0037929;C0032992;C0026896;C0020517;C0006055;C0235396;C0019080;C0041654;C1292856;C1292856;C0021308;C0018991;C3853796;C0026838;C1140618;C0021485;C0040053;C0021485;C0199230;C0226514;C0032961;C0009450;C0021485;C0087111;C0021485;C0039082;C0031843;C0031843;C2004454;C0031843;C0021102;C0021102;C0014544;C0039082;C0012634;C0549206;C0549206;C1552858;C0018787;C0038454;C0038454;C0025344;C0557034;C0220843;C0220843;C0700702;C0947630;C0700702;C0022885;C0022885;C0241158;C0015385;C0446516;C0446516;C0446516;C0446516;C1301624;C0012634;C2707260;C1550655;C1550655;C1550655;C1550655;C1550655;C1550655;C0009797;C1320102;C0699530;C0332534;C0973449;C4331837;C3534109;C4331837;C0749870;C1547299;C0031843;C0003707,C0026838;C0087111;C0038454,20140501,,,Completed,24401159,2,2.0,0.0031544287891259997,0.0027657905336009995

History of degenerative disease,"Stroke is the leading case of neurologic swallow dysfunction, or dysphagia. Post stroke      dysphagia is associated with approximately 50% increase in the rate of pneumonia diagnoses;      aspiration pneumonia is the most common respiratory complication in all stroke deaths,      accounting for a three-fold increase in the 30-day post stroke death rate. The long-term goal      of this systematic line of research is to decrease the morbidity, mortality, and health care      costs associated with disordered airway protection following stroke.      The overall hypothesis central to this proposal is that the ability to protect the airway is      dependent upon a continuum of multiple behaviors, including swallowing and cough. Safe,      efficient swallowing prevents material from entering the larynx and lower airway, and      effective cough ejects aspirate or mucus material. Currently, only one end of the continuum,      swallowing, is rigorously assessed in stroke patients. However, ineffective or disordered      cough is indicative of the inability to eject aspirate material or clear mucus and secretions      from the lower airway. Ineffective clearance and subsequent accumulation of material in the      lower airway increases the risk of chest infection. Hence, patients at the greatest risk for      chest infection would not only have disordered swallowing (dysphagia) but also disordered      cough (dystussia), meaning they are more likely to aspirate material and then cannot      effectively eject the aspirate from the airway. There is a high likelihood that swallowing      and cough are simultaneously disordered following stroke. To date, there is a treatment that      targets both swallowing and cough function in stroke patients.      Expiratory muscle strength training (EMST) increases expiratory muscle strength (Baker et      al., 2005) and there is evidence that supports its use to improve both swallow and cough      functions in patients with Parkinson's disease (Troche et al., in press). This cross-system,      device-driven approach to rehabilitating multiple contributors to airway protection deficits      is highly desirable in the stroke population due to the likelihood of the co-occurrence of      both swallow and cough disorders. To date, EMST has not been tested in stroke patients. We      propose that by including cough in the screening, evaluation and treatment processes for      disorders of airway protection, we will be able to better identify and treat patients most at      risk for airway compromise and associated sequelae.",stroke;dysphagia;dystussia;cough;maximum expiratory pressure;,Nervous System Diseases;Cardiovascular Diseases;,C0038454;C0010200;C0034991,C0034991;C0038454;C0010200,C0161818;C0032290;C0030567;C0872279;C0238990;C0238990;C0277785;C0086388;C0011167;C0011167;C0011167;C0036537;C0011167;C0011167;C0011167;C0231800;C0220825;C2945640;C0011168;C0011168;C0032285;C0011900;C0220880;C0429964;C0677505;C0011168;C0087111;C0012634;C0199230;C0087111;C0012634;C1948033;C0370199;C0370199;C0370199;C0370199;C0031843;C0243088;C0038454;C0038454;C3245511;C0038454;C0011065;C0038454;C0178987;C0038454;C0178987;C0023078;C0178987;C0038454;C0178987;C0178987;C0332148;C0178987;C0038454;C0038454;C0178987;C0038454;C0392366;C0038454;C0178987;C0178987;C0011065;C0010200;C0010200;C0026727;C0010200;C0026727;C0010200;C0010200;C0010200;C0010200;C0010200;C0010200;C0018017;C1299581;C4050373;C0031843;C0442797;C0935444;C0740170;C0184511;C0740170;C0740170;C4055506;C3842841;C1545588;C0231800;C1545588;C1545588;C0012634;C0012634;C0012634;C0012634;C0012634;C1382187;C3858576;C0013126;C1328018;C0034991,C0038454,C1285162;C0948008;C0018826;C0040053;C0012737;C0011168;C0027627;C0011168;C0027627;C0443343;C0199168;C0038454;C0262512;C0262926;C0262926;C0262926;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0221198;C0006826;C1547229;C0018670;C0027530;C0018670;C0027530;C0746866;C0009797;C1522449;C1550518;C1561542;C1561542,C0460139;C0231800,20150401,0.0,28.0,Completed,27130637,4,4.0,0.0033041634068490004,0.0026541612749050006

Study Aim The aim of this Introduction Many individuals after stroke continue to cope with      residual physical impairments after discharge from hospital. One of the major problems      encountered by people after stroke is community reintegration. Functional community      ambulation not only requires a critical level of postural control and walking skills, but      also the ability to engage in cognitive tasks while walking (i.e., dual-task walking) and      adapt to the constantly-changing environmental contexts. There has been an increasing      awareness of the importance of dual-task gait performance in community-dwelling individuals      with stroke in the past few years.      There is evidence showed that dual-task balance and gait performance is significantly      impaired after stroke. Increasing evidence also suggests that dual-task balance and gait      performance is useful for predicting falls among individuals with stroke. Considering the      high clinical relevance of dual-task balance and gait performance, it is essential that      stroke rehabilitation adequately addresses dual-task deficits.

Exclusion Criteria:          -  Consent declined.,"Stroke associated pneumonia (SAP) affects a fifth of stroke survivors annually, tripling the      risk of death at 30 days and contributing to poorer rehabilitation outcomes, prolonged      hospital stays and dependency at discharge. Systematic review evidence indicates that      enhanced oral health care (OHC) has a preventative effect on the incidence of pneumonia      amongst nursing home populations (absolute risk reductions 6.6% to 11.7%; numbers needed to      treat 8.6 to 15.3 individuals). There are strong theoretical reasons to suggest similar      benefits might be observed in stroke care settings but current empirical evidence is weak -      trial quality (randomisation, blinding, sample size, reporting), intervention description and      thus feasibility of translation into clinical practice is very poor. Following an extensive      pre-clinical programme of work, investigators now plan the pilot phase (Phase II) of a      stepped-wedge cluster RCT of a well-developed and defined complex OHC intervention versus      usual OHC.

Given uncertainty over the balance of potential modest benefits and risks, and      variability regarding the ideal head position policy for patients with acute ischemic stroke      around the world, reliable randomized evidence is required to standardize clinical practice.      The main objectives of this pilot phase clinical trial are to determine the feasibility,      safety and potential efficacy of a large-scale cluster randomized clinical trial to assess      whether a simple nursing care policy - 'lying flat head position' - provides beneficial      effects as compared to the standard upright head position in patients with acute ischemic      stroke. The main efficacy outcome of the pilot phase is demonstration of increased mean      cerebral blood flow velocity in the flat down compared to the upright head position, as      assessed by transcranial Doppler to the medial cerebral arteries of patients with anterior      circulation infarction. Secondary efficacy objectives are to demonstrate that the flat down      head position improves neurological status at 7 days and disability at 90 days.",stroke;head position;,Nervous System Diseases;Cardiovascular Diseases;,C2347268;C0038454;C0018670,C2347268;C0038454;C0018670,C0206034;C0373440;C0373440;C0746866;C0007770;C0948008;C0948008;C1096775;C0028678;C0087130;C0005775;C0018017;C0021308;C0018017;C0231170;C3858758;C3245501;C0237607;C2828392;C0014653;C0554756;C0242456;C0242456;C0038454;C0175659;C0018670;C0018670;C0018670;C0018670;C0018670;C0018670;C1518681;C3842337;C0723323;C4699589;C4699589;C0027627;C0231519;C0231519;C0231519;C0231519;C0231519;C0231519;C0022116;C3272565;C1555587;C0022116;C0751437;C0184511;C0591132;C0332535;C4082977;C0151576,C0038454,C0151699;C0014099;C1301624;C0018801;C0751956;C0005775;C2827758;C0087130;C0195897;C0031809;C0032285;C0042963;C0040405;C1457887;C0221423;C1446409;C3244317;C0018670;C0018670;C0018670;C1114365;C3843495;C1550655;C0935456;C1320102;C0231519;C0231519;C0231519;C1328018;C0751437;C4699193;C0041618,C0231519,20151001,,,Completed,28581366;27742914;26783317,1,0.33333333333333304,0.0030807419523400004,0.00242213255424

Patients may be             randomized who could and are willing to complete their follow-up at a participating             centre","Current management of patients with TIA (transient ischemic attack) or minor stroke includes      the prompt investigation and treatment in the days and weeks after the event. However, new      evidence shows patients are at the highest risk of stroke in the first few days after the      TIA, with 50% of strokes which happen in the three months following TIA occurring within      48-72 hours. To date, there is no evidence to guide physicians on how to safely reduce this      risk.      The FASTER trial is focusing on the initial period of high risk, starting patients on stroke      prevention treatments in the hours following a TIA or minor stroke. The drugs to be tested      have been shown to be effective in the similar setting of cardiology, reducing recurrent      cardiac events in patients with unstable angina when commenced with the same speed after an      event.      All patients will be on aspirin. The trial will see if adding another drug, clopidogrel, has      an additional benefit in reducing the number of strokes after TIA or minor stroke within      three months of TIA or minor stroke. It will also look if the very early introduction of      simvastatin, a cholesterol lowering therapy, reduces stroke after TIA or minor stroke, both      by itself and in addition to clopidogrel. The final aim of the trial is to ensure that these      treatments are safe to be used in this population of patients.",Transient Ischemic Attack;Stroke;Stroke Prevention;Recurrence;Neuroprotection;Antiplatelet Therapy;Statins;,"Nervous System Diseases;Cardiovascular Diseases;Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;",C0007787;C4055086;C0031809;C0038454;C0015663;C0012082,C0007787;C4055086;C0031809;C0038454;C0015663;C0012082,C0007787;C0002965;C0741923;C1552578;C0070166;C0074554;C0070166;C0376636;C0199176;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0332167;C0038454;C0542559;C0004057;C0038454;C0087111;C0038454;C0038454;C0025344;C0038454;C0038454;C0392366;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0013227;C0002658;C0013227;C1273517;C1578513;C0042789;C1820370;C0376495;C0201950;C0776963;C1561542;C1561542;C0018792;C0018792;C0018792,C1550450,C0003212;C0155626;C0151699;C0038525;C0948089;C0871470;C0427780;C0020540;C0521654;C1096021;C0521654;C1096021;C0004238;C1565489;C0086565;C0005779;C0018946;C0238154;C0581603;C2936643;C0423551;C2936643;C1301624;C0020517;C0040034;C0200633;C0948008;C0003281;C0002965;C0007786;C0005823;C1120149;C0032181;C0700589;C0520997;C0184661;C0520997;C0184661;C0524466;C0014118;C0009566;C0020538;C0020538;C0005779;C3665386;C0002978;C0070166;C0040207;C0027947;C0019080;C0031809;C0013227;C0201975;C0220825;C0886384;C0012833;C0009450;C0184661;C3714552;C0006104;C0549206;C0549206;C0237607;C0549206;C0019080;C0011265;C1457887;C1457887;C0042571;C0087111;C0004057;C0087111;C0037088;C0018787;C0018787;C1550655;C4318390;C0204695;C0204695;C0004057;C0262512;C0600109;C0038454;C0038454;C0004134;C0360714;C0003211;C0360714;C0449416;C3263723;C0006141;C0025663;C0006141;C0205082;C0027651;C0184252;C0006104;C0178784;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0013227;C0947630;C0013227;C0229671;C0013227;C0442996;C0087111;C4699619;C1550655;C1550655;C1550655;C1550655;C1550655;C1550655;C1550655;C1550655;C1550655;C1457887;C1550655;C1550655;C0009797;C1444662;C4684637;C4684637;C0360714;C3842337;C3842337;C0699794;C1697779;C1552658;C0332149;C0012000;C0332534;C0332534;C1555709;C0018792;C4331837;C0018792;C0018792;C4331837;C1553756;C4697772;C2707931;C3899561;C0033348;C1555587;C0728774;C3272565;C4283785;C4699193,C1550450;C0022116,20070201,,,Completed,17931979,76,76.0,0.002539409511263,0.0023575242134470003

It is the number      one cause of adult disability and third leading cause of death in the United States. Between      now and the year 2050, the cost of stroke in the United States will exceed 2 trillion      dollars. There is a tremendous ethnic disparity with respect to stroke in the United States.      Mexican Americans are much more likely to have a stroke compared with European Americans. In      Mexican Americans strokes occur at younger ages, are more likely to recur and have the same      severity as they do in European Americans. Mexican Americans are the overwhelming largest      sub-population of Hispanic Americans, the nation's largest minority group. This proposal, a      scientifically-based rigorous behavioral education intervention trial, seeks to aggressively      prevent stroke, especially in Mexican Americans.      Faith and family are strong components of Mexican American culture. This project works with      these positive fundamental elements in order to affect stroke prevention. This project will      take place in Nueces County, Texas. The project investigators have worked in this community      for the past 14 years and have published extensively regarding the stroke health disparity in      this stable, non-immigrant community of Mexican Americans and European Americans. We have      established a strong partnership with the Catholic Diocese of Corpus Christi and assembled a      team with tremendous experience at successful health behavior intervention research.      Together, a proposal has been crafted that will directly speak to aggressive stroke risk      factor reduction in Mexican Americans and European Americans in this representative United      States community.      The significance of such research is tremendous. As the Mexican American population grows and      ages, the stroke impact will be felt with greater and greater intensity. Now is the time to      develop aggressive, scientifically tested interventions to limit the burden of this disease      on this important segment of the United States population, and to reduce the costs of this      disease to the country as a whole, in keeping with the Government Performance and Results Act      (GPRA) goal to ""identify culturally appropriate, effective stroke prevention programs for      nationwide implementation in minority communities"" by FY2010.",Stroke;hypertension;diet;sodium;physical activity;,Nervous System Diseases;Cardiovascular Diseases;,C0013658;C0038454;C1328956,C0013658;C0038454;C1328956,C0679717;C1277289;C1171307;C0518902;C0007465;C0886296;C0184661;C0184661;C1277291;C0231170;C0237607;C0424927;C4551656;C1948033;C1446409;C1948033;C0012634;C0038454;C0012634;C0012634;C1550710;C0038454;C1301584;C0038454;C0680174;C0038454;C0332148;C0038454;C0332148;C0038454;C1301584;C0001721;C0038454;C0227813;C0038454;C0392366;C0038454;C0600116;C1561543;C0018017;C2825142;C2986890;C1547300;C1547300;C1704324;C4084912;C3858576;C1706074;C1328018;C1552839;C0018792;C1522411;C4086497;C0282547;C2363670;C1881720,,C0032961;C0600109;C1442065;C0600109;C0227813;C3810853;C1301584;C0947630;C0600116;C0947630;C0947630;C1299581;C1555587;C1515258;C3858576,C4049938,20131201,,,Completed,26374480;22421317,9,4.5,0.003089231921948,0.00216916902317

For many people with stroke who often have difficulty with walking,      achieving that intensity of activity is difficult. The result is that people with stroke      spend over 80% of their day in sedentary behaviours (too much sitting). A growing body of      research shows that too much sitting has negative effects on health including larger waist      circumference, unhealthy levels of blood glucose and insulin, heart disease, lower levels of      functioning, and premature death.      This project tests a new approach to activity promotion that focuses on increasing      light-intensity activity throughout the whole day while reducing sitting time. The new      intervention is titled ""STand Up Frequently From Stroke (STUFFS)"" and is aimed at increasing      self-confidence among people with stroke to sit less, stand up and walk around at frequent      intervals during the day. Studies in the general population have shown that standing up and      walking around frequently are beneficially associated with health indicators (lower waist      circumference, lower blood fat and glucose levels). Encouraging people with stroke to reduce      sitting and increase light-intensity activities appears feasible and sustainable and might be      a first step to increase their daily energy expenditure.",Stroke;Sedentary behaviour;Intervention;,Nervous System Diseases;Cardiovascular Diseases;,C0184661;C1705273;C0038454;C1548341;C1532253;C0184511,C0184661;C1705273;C0038454;C0038454;C1548341;C1532253;C0184511,C0014272;C0237529;C0428548;C0392201;C0018799;C0184661;C1299586;C0677505;C0021212;C0332218;C0205160;C0277814;C0277814;C0021641;C0277814;C0277814;C0038454;C0560560;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0038984;C0230097;C0011065;C0392366;C0596013;C0230097;C0005767;C1561538;C1578513;C1561538;C1578513;C0728713;C1561538;C0015677;C1518681;C0178520;C0151526;C4300452;C0275586;C0275586;C0221106;C0221106;C1547226;C4086497;C4049938;C3843660;C3843660;C4049938;C4049938;C0429028,C0038454,C0586003;C0221571;C0553692;C0162340;C0443343;C0038454;C1561542;C0596013;C1299581;C0016928;C1299581;C0022116;C3639196,,20180101,,,Completed,30566661,0,0.0,0.002664470738937,0.002012922632596
