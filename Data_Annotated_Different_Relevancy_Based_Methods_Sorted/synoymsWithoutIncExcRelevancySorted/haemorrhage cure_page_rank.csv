Likewise, aspirin is used by many      patients in order to prevent blood clots. Despite their desired benefits, these medicines can      cause internal bleeding from the digestive system. The source of this bleeding can be obvious      (overt), or obscure and thought to come from the small intestine. Obscure bleeding can show      as anemia due to lack of iron in the blood. Small intestine ulcers are now easily diagnosed      using an endoscope the size of a big pill (video capsule endoscopy). Small bowel ulcers are      not related to stomach acid and therefore do not heal using remedies usually taken to stop      acid formation. A different drug, misoprostol, consists of a chemical (prostaglandin) that is      usually lacking in patients using aspirin or anti-inflammatory drugs. Misoprostol is licenced      to heal stomach and duodenal ulcers in patients using these drugs. Our hypothesis is that      misoprostol might be effective in healing small bowel ulcers as suggested by pilot studies;      however, such works only included small numbers of patients, did not include control groups      and both patients and investigators knew the nature of the tablets used. To test this      hypothesis, we propose to compare misoprostol to a dummy tablet.

The primary therapy includes the administration of vasoactive      drugs, antibiotics and endoscopic therapy; preferably esophageal banding ligation (EBL)      and/or cyanoacrylate injection when bleeding occurs from gastric varices.      In this context, the idea is to assess ""Hemospray"" (Cook Medical, Winston-Salem, NC) as an      initial therapy in patients with massive bleeding as a temporary ""bridge"" until definitive      treatment could be instituted.      The data generated from the pilot study performed between Erasme hospital, ULB and TBRI ,      Cairo showed that adding Hemospray as early as possible in the management steps could      increase the bleeding control rate up to 95 % at 24 hours.      OBJECTIVE The primary efficacy objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of Hemospray      in combination with standard of care (SOC) medical treatment compared to the efficacy of SOC      in the Control Arm in patient with acute variceal bleeding in cirrhotic patient.      The primary safety objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of Hemospray when used      in combination with SOC compared to SOC in the Control Arm.      1.1.

SAH is a severe pathology leading not only to      neurological but also extra cerebral disorders. The major cause of morbidity and mortality      when developing a SAH is the secondary development of a delayed cerebral ischemia consecutive      to a prolonged vasospasm of cerebral arteries. The understanding of the pathophysiological      mechanisms of SAH complication, such as vasospasm which is the more frequent, is essential.      Vasospasm is defined as a reversible shrinking of an artery lumen diameter in the      subarachnoid space, beginning generally between 4 and 12 days after the hemorrhage. Such a      vasospasm could have a huge clinical impact leading to delayed neurological ischemic      deficiency in 17 to 40 % of cases. Up to day, mechanisms involved in vasospasm occurrence are      not well described.      Disposing of well-established genetics and transcriptomics databases along with cerebral      ischemia and inflammation is essential to unravel the mechanisms leading to vasospasm      occurrence on SAH patients. It will enable researchers to better comprehend SAH pathology and      elaborate an efficient and individualized therapeutic strategy to SAH acute phase in order to      reduce the risk of vasospasm occurrence.      Aims: 1) Constitute DNA and RNA Biobank via blood proofing oh SAH patients 2) Constitute a      database grouping clinical and biological data 3) Look for genetic and transcriptomic early      markers via genomic approaches 4) Correlate these different markers with vasospasm occurrence      and clinical evolution of the patients      Study: Patients inclusion will be done following their admission (D1) in the "" unité de      réanimation neurochirurgicale"" of Pitié-Salpètrière Hospital.

Endoscopic therapy significantly reduces further bleeding, surgery, and mortality      in patients with bleeding peptic ulcers and is now recommended as the first hemostatic      modality for these patients.      In the past few years, adjuvant use of a high-dose proton pump inhibitor (PPI) after      endoscopic therapy has been endorsed in some studies. Laine and Javid et al found that oral      PPI and IV PPI had a similar intragastric pH response in the past two years. Therefore,      whether oral can replace IV in the management of peptic ulcer bleeding is the objective in      this study.      The investigators enrolled 130 patients with active bleeding or nonbleeding visible      vessels（NBVV） in this study. They are randomly assigned as oral lansoprazole or IV nexium      group. All patients receive successful endoscopic therapy with heater probe or hemoclip      placement.      In the lansoprazole group (N=65), 30 mg four times daily is given orally for three days.      Thereafter, the patients receive 30 mg lansoprazole orally daily for two months. In the      nexium group, 160 mg/day continuous infusion is given for three days. Thereafter, the      patients receive 40 mg nexium orally daily for two months.      The primary end point is recurrent bleeding before discharge and within 14 days.

The rationale of using vasoconstrictor is to enhance      the efficacy of hemostasis by endoscopic therapy. Nowadays, endoscopic variceal ligation      (EVL) has replaced endoscopic injection sclerotherapy (EIS) as the endoscopic treatment of      choice in the arresting of acute esophageal variceal hemorrhage. EVL alone can achieve      hemotasis up to 97% even in cases of active variceal hemorrhage. However, early rebleeding      due to ligation-induced ulcer may be encountered.

Those whose             Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) ≤10[4] within 24 hours of lesion/admission will be defined as             critically ill patients. Three kinds of cases will be included: brain trauma             critically ill patients, cerebral haemorrhage critically ill patients or postoperative             brain tumour critically ill patients.        Exclusion Criteria:          -  If participating in any clinical trial, the subject cannot take part in this study.             Subjects are ineligible if they have below conditions:               1.

Evidence of active GI bleeding including oesophageal and gastric variceal                  bleeding, Peptic Ulcer Disease (PUD)","Stress ulcers or stress-related mucosal disease (SRMD) is defined as ""acute superficial      inflammation lesions of the gastric mucosa induced when an individual is subject to      abnormally elevated physiologic demands.""[1] Studies have shown that SRMD occurred in      75%-100% ICU patients[1]. Gastrointestinal bleeding due to SRMD is an important complication      in critically ill patients. The frequency of clinically important bleeding ranged from 5.3%      to 33%.[2] The mortality in ICU patients with stress related bleeding approaches 50%, which      is much higher than the patients without bleeding (9%). [3] In 1999, the American Society of      Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) published guidelines on the use of stress ulcer prophylaxis      in medical, surgical, respiratory, and pediatric ICU patients [2]. PPIs and H2RA are widely      used in China current clinical practice for the prevention of stress ulcer bleeding. However,      there is no epidemiology data to show the risk factors for stress ulcer bleeding and the      bleeding rate of Chinese neurosurgical critically ill patients who are usually suffering from      brain trauma, cerebral haemorrhage or brain tumour operation. Information is needed to know      about the characteristics in Chinese critically ill neurosurgical patients.      Objectives of this Non-Interventional Study Primary        1. Primary objective: To estimate the overall incidence of upper gastrointestinal (GI)           bleeding in critically ill neurosurgical patients in China.        2. Main secondary objective             -  To estimate the incidence of upper GI bleeding with clinically significant                complications in critically ill neurosurgical patients in China.             -  To estimate the incidence of any overt upper GI bleeding without clinically                significant complications in critically ill neurosurgical patients in China.             -  To assess time to upper GI bleeding after a cerebral lesion.             -  To investigate potential risk factors associated with upper GI bleeding, and assess                how common certain risk factors occurred in upper GI bleeding patients.             -  To assess the overall incidence of upper GI bleeding in critically ill patients by                different risk factors for upper GI bleeding.             -  To investigate the drugs, the route of administration, the doses and the duration                commonly used for stress ulcer prophylaxis.             -  To investigate the proportion of ICU patients with nasogastric tube, and the                duration of nasogastric tube.

Another research goal is to determine the degree of response to antiplatelet therapy      before and after surgery and to investigate whether patients by level of response to      antiplatelet therapy before surgery have a higher risk of perioperative bleeding.,cardiac surgery;aggregometry;thromboelastometry;platelet function;bleeding;antiplatelet therapy;,"Cardiovascular Diseases;Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;",C3661505;C0018821;C0229664;C0019080;C1550655,C3661505;C0018821;C0229664;C0162537;C0019080;C1550655,C1096021;C1096021;C0205042;C0370231;C0370231;C0087086;C0162537;C0162537;C0087111;C0031843;C0332149;C0019080;C1704632;C1704632;C0019080;C0018787;C0543467;C0087111;C0012634;C0543467;C0543467;C0542560;C0947630;C3245479;C0018017;C3661505;C3843761;C4082977,C0205042,C1956346;C0007202;C1260873;C0026265;C1096021;C1096021;C0543467;C0004936;C0018821;C0003486;C1533734;C0175636;C0005779;C0070166;C1546398;C0018787;C0018787;C0543467;C0012634;C1551393;C0018787;C0004057;C1551393;C0205082;C0184252;C3245479;C0182537;C0184661;C0184661;C1550655;C1550655;C1550655;C1550655;C1550655,C0018787;C0087111,20110101,,,Terminated,25231271,1,1.0,0.009778616183793,0.010754823413761999,> 18 years old;;;;;;;;;;Elective cardiac surgery patients;;;;;;;;;;Coronary artery disease;;;;;;;;;;Aortic valve disease;;;;;;;;;;Mitral valve disease;;;;;;;;;;Ascendent aorta aneurysm;;;;;;;;;;Combine coronary and valve disease;;;;;;;;;;Cardiac surgery procedures using cardiopulmonary bypass,Missing consent;;;;;;;;;;Patients with emergent cardiac surgical procedures;;;;;;;;;;Patients on antiplatelet therapy other than aspirin or clopidogrel;;;;;;;;;;Patients with inaccurate antiplatelet therapy administration documentation;;;;;;;;;;Missing data;;;;;;;;;;Off-pump procedures;;;;;;;;;;Patients younger than 18 years old;;;;;;;;;;Patients with severe mental disorders;;;;;;;;;;Intrinsic coagulopathy,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Experts agree that the combination of pharmacological and      endoscopic therapy should be the first line therapy in the acute bleeding episode; whereas      TIPS (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) is considered a rescue therapy.      Nevertheless, some patients would require different therapies to act as a ""bridge"" until      definitive therapy can be instituted. Balloon tamponade (using the Sengstaken tube)      represents, up to now, the most widely used temporary ""bridge"" to TIPS. However, balloon      tamponade is associated with a high incidence of serious adverse events.

However, despite overall increases in LARC      use in the United States from 1.5% in 2002 to 7.2% in 2011, and 11.6% most recently in 2015,      implant use continues to make up a small proportion of LARC use. While evidence to explain      this low uptake of implants is lacking, one potential reason is patient and provider concerns      about unpredictable bleeding.      As a result of this, many studies have been performed in attempts to discover therapies for      unscheduled bleeding in progestin-only contraceptive users. Some of these studies include      those investigating selective progesterone receptor modulators, such as mifepristone and      ulipristal acetate (UPA), which did find some benefit. Although a previous study showed mixed      benefit, the investigators feel that this medication has demonstrated both biologic      plausibility as well as clinically important outcomes. This previous study may not be      entirely translatable to the proposed research as therapies were used for different      indications (prophylaxis vs. treatment) and different progestins and delivery systems were      studied. Therefore, the investigators believe UPA should not be discounted as a potential      therapy. UPA may provide an additional safe and effective option for treatment of irregular      bleeding with implants in women. In addition, UPA is currently available in outpatient      pharmacies in the U.S. as a single 30mg oral tablet.      The investigators propose to investigate UPA for the treatment of unscheduled and troublesome      bleeding in ENG implant users.",Etonogestrel Implant;,"Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;",C0184661;C0019080,C2723461;C0184661;C0047683;C0019080;C0019080;C0021102;C2911690;C3897779,C0041747;C2723461;C0009871;C0700589;C0009871;C0047683;C0033308;C0026088;C0199176;C0013227;C0033306;C0087111;C0033306;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0021102;C1555587;C0019080;C0019080;C0011209;C0019080;C0021102;C0019080;C0021102;C0021102;C0947630;C0947630;C0087111;C0021102;C0025663;C0243144;C0087136;C0947630;C0947630;C1527305;C1273517;C0013853;C1550472;C0042071;C0042071;C0042071;C0042071;C0042071;C0013853;C1555587;C4084912;C4084912;C0700651;C1706074;C0718641;C0005525;C4697740,C0019080,C1546417;C0745411;C2723461;C2723461;C1301624;C0020517;C0006949;C0069751;C0006142;C0581126;C0006147;C0004745;C0018242;C1516879;C1516879;C0076829;C0013227;C0277786;C0457801;C0060135;C0031507;C0032961;C0019080;C0252643;C0035608;C0442711;C0019080;C0021102;C1550655;C0021102;C0009653;C0032042;C0470166;C0021102;C0042149;C0205065;C0025344;C0725694;C0725694;C0947630;C0376660;C0376660;C1527021;C3540777;C3842337;C1320102;C2911690;C0075414;C4331837;C4331837;C4283785;C0027530,C0047683;C0021102,20180131,0.0,195.0,Completed,30130351,0,0.0,0.015547978804303999,0.010273021751491,Women age 18-45;;;;;;;;;;Implant placed >90 days and <3 years prior to enrollment;;;;;;;;;;Patient complaint of bothersome irregular bleeding with implant;;;;;;;;;;Willing to be abstinent or use condoms during study period;;;;;;;;;;Willing to complete 30-day bleeding diary;;;;;;;;;;Willing to be randomized to placebo or ulipristal acetate;;;;;;;;;;Ability to send/receive SMS text message,"Non-English speaking;;;;;;;;;;Implant placed >3 years prior to enrollment;;;;;;;;;;Contraindication to ulipristal acetate (current use of barbiturates, bosentan,             carbamazepine, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, rifampin, St. John's             Wort, topiramate, known or suspected pregnancy, hypersensitivity to active substance             or excipients, uterine/cervical/ovarian/breast cancer, severe asthma insufficiently             controlled by oral glucocorticoids);;;;;;;;;;Inability or unwillingness to comply with medication protocol;;;;;;;;;;Inability or unwillingness to comply with bleeding diary;;;;;;;;;;Breastfeeding",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Patients who refuse to receive blood transfusion.,"Severe maternal bleeding is a serious complication of birth and causes 125.000 deaths      worldwide each year. The investigators aim to investigate if early treatment with fibrinogen      concentrate versus saline can reduce the incidence of blood transfusion in women with      postpartum haemorrhage.      A low level of fibrinogen has been associated with increased blood loss and transfusion      requirements in different clinical settings including obstetrical bleeding. Early up-front      treatment with fibrinogen may reduce incidence of transfusion by securing optimal haemostatic      capacity in women with postpartum haemorrhage.      The investigators plan to enrol 245 patients on four hospitals in the Capital Region of      Denmark during a two year period.

The average      age of a patient with subarachnoid haemorrhage is 50 years, although it is often seen in      younger people (25-45 years). Despite modern medicine, the death and disability rate remains      high both from the initial bleed and from the associated complications such as vasospasm.      This is characterised by neurological impairment seen following the bleed. Despite modern      treatment this is still associated with a poor outcome. This has significant implications due      to the long term intensive neuro-rehabilitation these patients will require.      A recent study has shown that placing a small drain in the lower back following a      subarachnoid haemorrhage may reduce the chance of vasospasm occurring and result in a better      outcome. This trial was not optimally performed and so a trial is needed to look at this in      more detail. The investigators have set up such a trial in our neurosurgical unit. If the      investigators confirm that there is an improvement in patient outcome, it will change our      practice in the future.",Subarachnoid haemorrhage;Aneurysm;Cerebrospinal fluid drainage;,"Cardiovascular Diseases;Nervous System Diseases;Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;",C0013103;C0024090;C0019080;C0003707,C0007806;C2911690;C0013103;C0024090;C0751530,C0038525;C0038525;C0038525;C0521654;C0034991;C0009566;C0231170;C0230102;C0085616;C0087111;C0085616;C0237607;C0750484;C0011065;C0019080;C0019080;C0947630;C0013103;C1561543;C0036849;C3245501;C3806166;C0001721;C0009566;C3844714;C1547581;C0018792;C0018792;C0018792;C0013227,C0019080;C0038525,C0240059;C0038525;C0038525;C1458140;C1517569;C0037943;C0524466;C0019080;C0271510;C0019080;C0018827;C0018944;C0018944;C0018944;C0018944;C0547053;C0687696;C0040405;C1545665;C0684258;C0547053;C0040405;C1518681;C3244317;C0577559;C1561538;C1561538;C0009797;C0009797;C0271510;C0233256;C4331837;C0221874;C0221874;C3172260;C3172260;C1301624,C0012621;C0003707,20100701,,,Completed,22282887,9,9.0,0.009383470512639,0.009622941894157,"Aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage.;;;;;;;;;;Recruitment prior to day three post-haemorrhage.;;;;;;;;;;Written informed consent or relative assent given.;;;;;;;;;;WFNS grade 1-3.;;;;;;;;;;Fisher grade 2, 3 and 4 (without space occupying haematoma) on initial CT scan.;;;;;;;;;;No intraventricular haemorrhage, space occupying haematoma or other contra-indication             to lumbar puncture.",Non-aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage.;;;;;;;;;;Delayed presentation / recruitment (after day three post-haemorrhage);;;;;;;;;;Written informed consent or relative assent denied or unobtainable.;;;;;;;;;;WFNS grade 4 or;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Fisher grade 1 on initial CT scan.;;;;;;;;;;Intraventricular haematoma obstructing ventricular outflow.;;;;;;;;;;Intracranial haematoma with mass effect.;;;;;;;;;;Bleeding diathesis.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The call should last only a minute or two and at the end of it the      randomisation service will specify which numbered treatment pack to use. For hospitals where      telephone randomisation is not feasible, randomisation will be by taking the next      consecutively numbered treatment pack.

Bleeding after      tonsillectomy is one of the risks of this surgery and can be more dangerous in children since      they have less blood volume than adults. In order to improve recovery after tonsillectomy,      steroids (medication that is a strong anti-inflammatory) are often given during the surgery.      Recently, a study showed steroids given at the time of tonsillectomy increase the risk of      bleeding significantly over children who did not receive steroids. This finding has raised      concerns in the Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT) community since most ENT's use steroids during      tonsillectomy in children. The investigators look to explore this question further.      To answer the question of whether perioperative steroid administration significantly affects      the rate of post-tonsillectomy bleeding, the investigators propose to test the following      hypotheses in a prospective, randomized, blinded placebo-controlled trial: dexamethasone does      not cause an increase in post-operative bleeding rate in tonsillectomy.",,"Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;",C0011777;C0040423;C0019080,C0011777;C0040423;C0019080,C1533734;C0040423;C0040423;C0040423;C0040423;C0040423;C0040423;C0011777;C0040423;C0005850;C0013227;C0019080;C0038317;C0038317;C0019080;C0038317;C0038317;C0019080;C0019080;C0015252;C0040421;C0543467;C0543467;C0543467;C0037088;C0038317;C0032042;C3245511;C0031354;C3244317;C0947630;C3244317;C0028429;C0392366;C0013443;C0508431;C0003209;C2004454;C0184511;C0180799;C0001721;C2911690;C1522411;C0018792;C1522634;C0030201,C0019080,C4551689;C0193959;C0193959;C0005779;C0001617;C0013804;C0241889;C0001617;C0040423;C0040423;C0596392;C1304888;C0040425;C0013893;C1516879;C0441199;C3245501;C0543467;C0032105;C1561610;C0439044;C0181467;C0012634;C0012634;C1514811;C3841442;C1550655;C1550655;C1552867;C1550655;C1552867;C1552867;C0009797;C4082977;C3809765;C0009450;C0939261,C1140111,20111101,0.0,942.0,Completed,23011712,5,5.0,0.011035873976045,0.009134775370553001,"Patients ages 3 to 18 undergoing tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy by electrocautery             alone for the indication of sleep disordered breathing or infectious tonsillitis.;;;;;;;;;;Patients with complex medical conditions or craniofacial abnormalities will be             included.;;;;;;;;;;Informed consent and child assent are required for enrollment.;;;;;;;;;;Eligibility will be determined by the principal investigator, associate investigator             or research nurse.","Subjects with a known personal or family history of any bleeding disorder will be             excluded.;;;;;;;;;;Subjects currently on oral corticosteroids for other medical conditions or have             recently taken any oral corticosteroid within two weeks of surgery.;;;;;;;;;;Patients with tonsillectomy performed using a cold knife technique, microdebrider,             coblation or plasma knife due to surgeon or parent preference.;;;;;;;;;;Where appropriate subjects who do not have informed consent or child assent signed             will be excluded;;;;;;;;;;Children less than three years old will be excluded due to the fact the majority of             these children at the collaborating centers have an adenotonsillectomy using the             microdebrider for pain control purposes.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A recent      meta-analysis of hetastarch use in on-pump CABG concluded that use of hetastarch in these      procedures is associated with increased risk, but the safety of hetastarch use in off-pump      procedures remains unresolved.      We designed a double-blinded randomized clinical trial to investigate this question. The      study was designed as an equivalence trial. Statistical power calculations were performed      taking this into consideration. Sealed assignments from a block randomization table developed      prior nto initiation of the trial were unsealed in the operating room. These were used to      assign patients scheduled for off-pump CABG to receive either 1 L of hetastarch or 1 L of      albumin as part of intraoperative volume replacement. Albumin was used for all subsequent      intraoperative and postoperative fluid replacement.      The rate of postoperative bleeding was assessed prospectively by monitoring hourly chest tube      drainage and number of units of blood products transfused postoperatively in the Intensive      Care Unit. Risk was assessed by a Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) established for      this trial. The SAMC was scheduled per protocol to meet after the first 15 subjects (both      groups combined) had 1000cc or more of chest tube drainage in the first 12 hours      postoperative, and then subsequently either after 15 additional bleeds of this volume or      following a schedule set at the discretion of the DSMC.      The trial was continued until 156 patients had been recruited. At that time, 78 participants      each had been assigned to the hetastarch and albumin groups. DSMC review at that time      determined that use of hetastarch is associated with a risk of postoperative bleeding which      is greater than the risk associated with use of albumin and the DSMC accordingly halted the      trial.","Coronary artery bypass, Off-pump;Hetastarch;Plasma substitutes;Equivalence;","Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;",C1536078;C0009566;C0020352;C0019080;C0182537;C0018787,C1536078;C0009566;C0020352;C0019080;C1170317;C0182537;C0018787,C0010055;C0206034;C0032788;C0032788;C0032788;C0521302;C0456388;C0282458;C0518609;C0184114;C0035139;C0035139;C0020352;C0020352;C0020352;C0020352;C0589507;C0020352;C0150369;C0008034;C0150369;C0020352;C0020352;C0012621;C0442711;C0086960;C1552601;C0201838;C1552839;C0019080;C1552839;C0282443;C0947630;C0028778;C1706074;C0817096;C0182537;C0182537;C1273517;C0182537;C1273517;C1509845;C0036849;C0184661;C0184661;C0086960;C0086960;C4699158;C4082977;C1135564;C1135564;C2363670;C1328018;C0018792;C4331837;C0018792;C0018792;C0018792;C0018792;C1522634;C0600673;C1444662,C0019080;C0032788,C2316810;C0005779;C0553534;C0553534;C0010055;C0010055;C0086960;C0086960;C0543467;C0543467;C0262512;C0018787;C0543467;C0262512;C0741847;C0741847;C0182537;C0182537;C4698437;C4698437,C0010055,20050801,,,Completed,19698859,8,8.0,0.008254643343058001,0.009096026790219999,"Scheduled coronary bypass graft surgery that is planned to be conducted on adults             off-pump (i.e., without use of cardio-pulmonary bypass).","Scheduled coronary bypass graft surgery that is planned to be conducted on adults             on-pump (i.e., with use of cardio-pulmonary bypass).;;;;;;;;;;A history of cardiac surgery;;;;;;;;;;A history of primary bleeding disorders;;;;;;;;;;End-stage renal disease",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It may occur      spontaneously or secondary to traction from a localized posterior vitreous detachment. This      complication may greatly disturb the central vision and may be an important stimulant of      fibrovascular proliferation.      Bevacizumab (Avastin, Genentech, Inc.) is a humanized monoclonal antibody against vascular      endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which has been used to treat a variety of neovascular      ocular diseases. In proliferative diabetic retinopathy, intravitreal bevacizumab has been      shown to induce prompt regression of neovascularization and may enhance resolution of      vitreous hemorrhage.      In this study, we propose that simultaneous intravitreal injection of gas and bevacizumab may      be a useful treatment option in diabetic premacular hemorrhage with active fibrovascular      tissue. In this procedure, gas is used to displace the blood while bevacizumab may render the      neovascularization less active to decrease the likelihood of recurrent hemorrhage.",Bevacizumab;Diabetic premacular hemorrhage;Intravitreal gas;,"Cardiovascular Diseases;Endocrine System Diseases;Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;Eye Diseases;",C0796392;C0019080;C1533685;C0241863;C0718247;C0596601;C0334094,C0796392;C0019080;C1533685;C0241863;C0718247;C0596601;C0334094,C0423361;C0011884;C0042909;C0027686;C0027686;C0683525;C0334094;C0334094;C0009566;C0796392;C0796392;C0796392;C0796392;C0019080;C0746619;C0684320;C0019080;C0019080;C0027627;C0002763;C0021485;C0184661;C0241863;C0040597;C0003241;C0005847;C0012634;C0241863;C1135130;C0035298;C0042789;C0018270;C0015392;C0005767;C0947630;C0005767;C1273517;C1273517;C0596601;C0596601;C0442797;C4068891;C4068891;C0227662;C1320102;C1320102;C1514893;C0751438;C4084912,C0035309,C0339467;C0150457;C0018939;C0334094;C0441509;C0019080;C0042903;C0241863;C0205161;C0205082;C1547229;C1320102,C0596601,20081201,,,Unknown status,18682973,1,1.0,0.008189891997201,0.008619926288338001,Acute diabetic premacular hemorrhage and minor active fibrovascular proliferation,Anticoagulant therapy;;;;;;;;;;Blood diseases associated with abnormal coagulation;;;;;;;;;;Proliferative retinopathy severe enough to warrant vitrectomy,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
