AD patients differ in the time course of neuronal degeneration and accompanying      cognitive decline.      With recent advances in MR imaging, including optimized data acquisition and processing      techniques, tools that are especially well suited for tracking long-term pathological changes      as well as drug treatment effects have become available. In addition to structural imaging,      new acquisition and analysis techniques have been developed to determine integrity of      subcortical fiber tracts in vivo.      In the present project we propose to determine predictors of disease progression and      treatment response and investigate potential treatment effects on structural disease      progression, covering the continuum from axonal degeneration to cortical neuronal loss taking      advantage of recent advances in MRI acquisition and analysis techniques.",Alzheimer's disease;diffusion tensor imaging;,Nervous System Diseases;,C0002395;C0016967;C0087111;C0939465;C1537007;C1305866,C0002395;C0016967;C0087111;C0012634;C0939465;C1537007;C0231221;C1305866,C0002395;C0242656;C0338656;C0011164;C0011164;C0011164;C0815275;C0815275;C0242656;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C1704632;C0079595;C0079595;C0150312;C0012634;C1185740;C0225326;C3245479;C0013227;C1578513;C1833299;C1518681;C1518681;C3839460;C2363670;C0308269;C0015733;C0001613;C4082977;C4082977,C0002395,C0085615;C0008425;C0007820;C0338656;C0011849;C0544724;C0040128;C0018799;C0002962;C0008909;C0018801;C0085762;C0086769;C2707261;C0035648;C0020538;C0011164;C0004083;C0003811;C0012634;C0011900;C0012634;C0750484;C0012634;C0012634;C0025242;C0220908;C0012634;C0012634;C0332148;C0006104;C0443343;C0012634;C0012634;C0018787;C0021308;C0262512;C0262512;C2923685;C0262512;C0392366;C0262512;C0027769;C0262512;C0600109;C0038454;C0025260;C0725694;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0013227;C1299581;C1555587;C0009797;C0031809;C1444662;C1548428;C0233492;C4054353;C1561542;C1706074;C1561542;C3534109;C4331837;C0973449;C3534109;C2702329;C4284141;C3272565;C0022116;C1550518,C0079595,20080901,,,Unknown status,26796681,4,4,0.050485626898783,0.047785718723043
