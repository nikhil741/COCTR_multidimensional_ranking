Acute malnutrition      is a major contributor to under-5 mortality and morbidity in developing countries. While      clinical guidelines for severe acute malnutrition (SAM) have been available for a decade,      research on the management of moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) has lagged behind.      Nonetheless, MAM is much more incident than SAM, it increases mortality risk by itself and      requires special nutritional treatment. This study is thus meant to address this major gap,      by testing the relative feasibility, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of three innovative      strategies for treating children with MAM aged 6-24 months : a locally produced Ready-to-Use      Therapeutic Food (RUTF), a corn/soy blended flour (CSB++)provided by the World Food Program,      and a specific and context-appropriate child-centred counselling.

Unfortunately many dialysis patients die, so that after 5 years only      less than 35% are still alive. Dialysis patients who appear malnourished or who have muscle      and fat wasting are even more likely to die. Interestingly, among dialysis patients,      minorities (African Americans, Hispanics and Asian Americans) usually survive longer than the      non-Hispanic Whites. If the investigators can discover the reasons for these so-called      ""racial survival disparities"" of dialysis patients, the investigators may be able to improve      survival for all dialysis patients and maybe even for many other people who suffer from other      chronic diseases. During this 5 year study the investigators would like to test if a      different nutrition and diet can explain better survival of minority dialysis patients. The      investigators will also test if in additional to nutrition there are 2 other reasons for      better survival of minority dialysis patients, namely differences in bone and minerals and      differences in social and psychological and mental health. The investigators plan to study      450 hemodialysis patients every 6 months in several dialysis clinics in Los Angeles South Bay      area. These subjects will include 30% African Americans, 30% Hispanics, 30% non-Hispanic      Whites and 10% Asians. Every 6 months the investigators will examine their nutritional      conditions, dietary intake, psycho-social conditions and quality of life, and will recruit 75      new subjects to replace those who left our study as a result of kidney transplantation, death      or other reasons. Hence, the investigators estimate studying a total of 1,050 hemodialysis      patients over 5 years. Clinical events such as hospital admissions and survival will be      followed. Blood samples will be obtained every 6 months for measurements of hormones and      ""biomarkers"", and the remainder of the blood will be stored in freezers for future      measurements. The investigators plan to design and develop race and ethnicity specific      nutritional risk scores and food questionnaires and will test some of these scores in larger      national databases of hemodialysis patients.

Physiologically, malnourished children excrete lower amounts of salts      and water in diarrhoeal stools, and they also are unable to handle excessive salts and water      load. Some times they are found to be hyponatraemic due to the shift of sodium inside the      cells (inefficient Na+ /K+ pump), and fluids containing higher amounts of sodium (such as the      standard ORS) may lead to further increase in the intracellular sodium, fluid overload and      heart failure. They also have depleted in potassium stores in the body. Recently, the WHO      recommended a special ORS formulation, known as ReSoMal, for management of diarrhoea in      severely malnourished children that contains a lower amount of sodium (45mmol/L) and higher      amount of potassium (40 mmol/L) than the standard WHO-ORS. It is felt that an ORS containing      lower sodium and higher potassium concentration may be useful in correcting hypokalemia, and      in lowering the risks of excess sodium and /or overhydration, in severely malnourished      children with diarrhoea. The safety of ReSoMaL is, however, still in question due to the risk      of hyponatraemia, including symptomatic hyponatraemia, especially in the treatment of severe      watery diarrhoea due to Vibrio cholerae and ETEC where loss of sodium in the stool exceeds      than that is contained in ReSoMal. Thus an ORS solution with modest concentration of sodium      (75 mmol/L) and higher concentration of potassium (40 mmol/L) have been suggested for the      treatment of diarrhoea in these children. To improve the efficacy of oral rehydration, in      terms of reducing the severity of purging and diarrhoea duration, different approaches      (changing the substrates/ reducing the sodium and glucose concentration and osmolarity) have      been tried with limited success. Benefiber (partially hydrolysed guar gum), a soluble fiber      if added to a ORS solution is expected to be fermented in the colon liberating short chain      fatty acids (SCFAs). SCFAs stimulate sodium and water absorption from the colon, and they      have trophic effect, act as a fuel source for the colonocytes, have antibacterial properties      and stimulates the production commensal flora, thereby may enhance recovery from acute      diarrhoea in severely malnourished children. The aims of our proposed study are to examine      whether an ORS solution with a modest concentration of sodium will prevent the occurrence of      hyponatraemia including symptomatic hyponatraemia, and also whether addition of benefiber      will improve the efficacy of ORS solution. This will be a randomized, double blind,      controlled clinical trial in 186 children with severe malnutrition and watery diarrhoea (62      in each of the three treatment groups) to compare the efficacy of (i) the currently      recommended ORS with some modofication(Na+ 75 mmol/L and K40 momol/L and minerals-Zinc,      copper and magnesium), (ii) ReSoMal (Na+ 45 mmol/L), (iii) Currently recommended ORS (Na+ 75      mmol/L, K 40 momol/L and added minerals) with added Benefiber (25 grams/L), in the treatment      of acute watery diarrhoea in children with severe malnutrition",Diarrhoea;;Severe malnutrition;;Benefiber;;ReSoMal;;modified ORS;,"Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases;",C0205082;C0162429,C0086904;C0086904;C0220825;C0087111;C0011991;C0061996;C0205082;C0162429;C0043047,C0936233;C0427743;C0311276;C0311276;C0086904;C0546817;C0857122;C0018801;C0086045;C0020488;C0392689;C0020625;C0020625;C0086045;C0086045;C0279516;C0086045;C0020625;C0020625;C0162429;C0162429;C0162429;C0162429;C0162429;C1273518;C0020621;C0376636;C0029387;C2347023;C0011991;C0221423;C0032821;C0011991;C0032821;C0032821;C0011991;C0087111;C0011991;C0032821;C0087111;C0011991;C0011991;C1828805;C0011991;C0011991;C0087111;C1828805;C0087111;C0011991;C2828392;C0205082;C2828392;C0205082;C0061996;C0205082;C0221102;C0078516;C0855227;C3245511;C0011065;C0015733;C0566415;C0205082;C1518681;C0449416;C1552839;C0009968;C0043047;C0043047;C0015733;C0225326;C0009368;C0043047;C0009368;C0947630;C0456909;C0182537;C1442948;C0043481;C0231221;C0231221;C0011991;C1820370;C0008354;C0544691;C2004454;C0184511;C0151514;C0000589;C0184511;C0668326;C0668326;C0668326;C0668326;C0035150;C1828805;C0373675;C0332534;C4055646;C0449878;C0449878;C0043047;C0043047;C0043047;C0776963;C0776963;C0776963;C1701972;C4025593;C0231184;C1522634;C0701928;C3834249;C0220644;C3536899,,C0278384;C0476273;C0424670;C0085559;C0011175;C0162791;C0025289;C0004048;C0011991;C0032285;C0012634;C0205082;C0015733;C0205082;C0205082;C0036690;C0013604;C0005767;C0026727;C0013227;C0009797;C4086490;C3272565,,20090701,,,Completed,26825757,1,1.0,0.031490298974886,0.021832903508975,Some or severe dehydration (assessed by WHO Guidelines).;;;;;;;;;;Weight for height (W/H) <70% of NCHS median or with bipedal edema.;;;;;;;;;;Written informed consent from parents/ guardians,"Blood or mucus in stools;;;;;;;;;;Have received antidiarhoeal drugs for their diarrhoea;;;;;;;;;;Severe diseases (e.g. severe pneumonia with respiratory distress, clinical sepsis,             meningitis) requiring intensive care and other ancillary support like O2 inhalation,             oropharyngeal suction etc.",1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

The introduction of ready to use      therapeutic foods (RUTF), in particular Plumpy'Nut (Nutriset, France) allowed for the      treatment of the majority of children at their homes using ambulatory treatment. Children      with complicated cases were cared for in an inpatient center. With ambulatory treatment the      number of children cared for in the MSF program reached close to 70000 in 2006.      This study aimed to assess the effect of a 3-month distribution of RUTF in the context of a      preventative supplementary feeding program. The primary hypotheses were that short-term RUTF      supplementation at the village-level would prevent declines in weight-for-height and reduce      the incidence of wasting in children 6 to 60 mo of age over a period of 8 mo.

In Austria, the prevalence of frailty and malnutrition are      increasing steadily and are becoming a challenge for our social system. Physical training and      adequate nutrition can invert it.      Methods/Design: In this randomized, controlled trial 80 malnourished, frail,      community-dwelling patients (≥ 65 years) are recruited. Additionally, 80 lay volunteers (≥ 50      years) named buddies are recruited and subsequently trained regarding health enhancing      physical activity and nutrition in three standardized training sessions. These buddies visit      the malnourished, frail subjects at home twice a week for about one hour during an initial      period of 10-12 weeks. While participants allocated to the intervention group (n=40) conduct      intervention to improve their fluid intake, their protein and energy intake, perform strength      training and try to increase their baseline activities, the control group (n=40) only gets      home visits without any special intervention. After 10-12 weeks, both, the intervention and      the control group, receive the nutrition intervention and the physical training. Health,      nutrition and frailty status, physical fitness and body composition and chronic inflammation      of buddies and frails are recorded before the intervention, after 10-12 weeks, and after 6      and 12 months.      Discussion: To the investigators knowledge this trial is the first of its kind to provide      nutrition and physical activity intervention to malnourished, frail, community-dwelling      subjects by trained lay buddies, in which the health status of buddies is also expected to      improve. This study assesses the effectiveness of such an intervention.

The management of malnutrition has an impact in reducing postoperative      complications. However malnutrition is rarely detected and Guidelines infrequently followed.      Recovery time and nutritional evaluation in elderly patients are major criteria in their      postoperative management. Identifying malnutrition or malnutrition risk is fundamental to its      treatment. It is therefore unsurprising that many validated tools for nutrition risk      screening and nutrition assessment exist for the clinician to use in assisting with the      accurate identification, referral and treatment of patients who are malnourished or at risk      of malnutrition.      And nutritional management must be adapted and based on this evaluation and evolution of the      general status (Guidelines Grade A).

An estimated 20% of children in the developing world are malnourished      [1] and poor nutrition is linked to more than half of all child deaths worldwide [2].      Malnutrition in early childhood may lead to cognitive and physical deficits and may cause      similar deficits in future generations as malnourished mothers give birth to low birth weight      children [3]. In addition, malnutrition increases susceptibility and incidence of infections      and is associated with diminished response to vaccines.      The MAL-ED Project is designed to determine the impact of enteric infections/diarrhea that      alter gut function and impair children's nutrition, growth and development to help develop      new intervention strategies that can break the vicious enteric infection-malnutrition cycle      and reduce its global burden.      The overall objective of the MAL-ED Project is to quantify the associations of specific      enteric pathogens, measures of physical and mental development, micronutrient malnutrition,      gut function biomarkers, the gut microbiome, and immune responses in very young children in      resource-limited settings across eight sites that vary by culture, economics, geography, and      climate.      The central hypothesis of the MAL-ED Project is that infection (and co-infection) with      specific enteropathogens leads to impaired growth and development and to diminished immune      response to orally administered vaccines by causing intestinal inflammation and/or by      altering intestinal barrier and absorptive function. Data analyses will test for associations      between enteropathogen infections and growth/development to help illuminate:        -  which micro-organisms or mixed infections are most frequently associated with growth           faltering and poor development; and        -  at what age specific infections cause the most disruption to growth and development and           impair immune response.",Cognitive development;Diarrheal disease;Enteric infections;Malnutrition;Vaccine Response;Enteropathy;Antibiotic use;Micronutrients;Breast feeding;Gut inflammation;,"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses;Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases;",C0162429;C0008078;C0678723;C0851162;C0699268,C0035648;C0162429;C0008078;C0678723;C0851162;C0699268,C0018271;C0018271;C0018271;C0599735;C0018271;C0024032;C0162429;C0012655;C0162429;C0035648;C0162429;C0524343;C0162429;C0162429;C0162429;C0184661;C0162429;C0162429;C0021368;C0243107;C3714514;C3714514;C0679199;C0005516;C0021853;C0021853;C3714514;C3714514;C3714514;C0220880;C0392209;C0009450;C0018017;C0009450;C0009450;C1704632;C0042210;C0011991;C0031843;C1552740;C0031843;C1552740;C1704632;C0042210;C0031843;C1552740;C1704632;C1706912;C0439662;C0439662;C0018270;C0439662;C0005615;C1442948;C1552861;C0392366;C1552861;C0699819;C1578513;C0699819;C0699819;C0004083;C0004083;C1704632;C0542559;C0011164;C3539125;C3845919;C0311392;C0441229;C0056685;C0031809;C0016538;C2363670;C0016538;C3834249;C0282547;C0016538;C0220644;C4082977,,C0264716;C0019993;C0010674;C0022658;C0023895;C0032961;C0012634;C0011900;C0011900;C0012634;C0012634;C0205082;C0205082;C0566415;C0947630;C0005615;C0005615;C3649644;C0741302;C1555587;C0009797,C0021368,20170401,,,Unknown status,29684739;28592604;28381477,5,1.6666666666666698,0.017557701305417,0.019526609202791,Less than 17 days old.,"Mother is less than 16 years of age.;;;;;;;;;;Mother has another child inthe MAL-ED study.;;;;;;;;;;Pregnancy resulted in multiple birth (e.g., twins).;;;;;;;;;;Child has a severe disease requiring hospitalization for something other than for a             typical healthy birth.;;;;;;;;;;Child has a severe or chronic condition diagnosed by a medical doctor (e.g., neonatal             disease, renal disease, chronic heart failure, liver disease, cystic fibrosis,             congenital conditions).;;;;;;;;;;Child has enteropathies diagnosed by medical doctor.;;;;;;;;;;Mother is living and unable to provide informed consent.",1,1,0,0,5,0,0,4,0,4

Usual follow-up (fortnightly for 1st 3 months) service at the hospital nutrition           follow-up unit (HNFU) including growth monitoring and promotion + health education +           micronutrient supplementation and treatment of intercurrent illness (current standard           practice; control group).        2. All management like control group, but follow up at community-based nutrition follow-up           unit (CNFU) (fortnightly for 1st 3 months) (intervention A).        3. All management like intervention A at CNFU + supplementary food (SF) for the first 3           months (intervention B).        4. All management like intervention A at CNFU + psychosocial stimulation (PS) for the first           3 months (intervention C).        5. All management like intervention A at CNFU + SF + PS for the first 3 months           (intervention D).      After the initial three months intervention period, children in all groups will be followed      on fortnightly basis for next three months in their respective follow up unit.      Follow-up rate, nutritional status, mental and psychomotor development, behavior, morbidities      (including intestinal permeability in a sub-sample) of the children, and child rearing      practices, depression and self esteem of mothers will be assessed in different groups.      By ascertaining the most cost-effective/best management package, and by extending the package      to other systems in the country, it will be possible to rehabilitate a greater number of      severely malnourished children in their communities.","Community based follow up, severely underweight children;",Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases;,C0205082;C0162429,C0242296;C0184661;C0376636;C0205082;C1548341;C1458132;C0162429;C1292856;C3897779,C0033137;C0392209;C0242297;C0162429;C0886296;C0886296;C0184661;C0184661;C0184661;C0184661;C1458132;C0184661;C0184661;C0184661;C0184661;C0162429;C0243107;C1292856;C0243107;C0036597;C0376636;C0150369;C0376636;C0376636;C0376636;C0376636;C0021853;C0011570;C0376636;C0220880;C0392209;C0424927;C0087111;C0392209;C0237607;C0184511;C0205082;C2828392;C0237607;C0332149;C0205082;C0025663;C0221423;C1550710;C0018270;C1305866;C0018270;C0025344;C1552839;C0229992;C1552839;C0947630;C0724128;C0870814;C3540798;C0870814;C0870814;C1550472;C0677505;C0009488;C3539125;C0441621;C2363670;C0220825;C1561542;C1561542;C1561542;C1561542;C1561542;C1561542;C1561542;C1561542;C3534109;C1552839;C1552839;C3272565,C0162429,C0008679;C0019993;C1306341;C0162429;C1299586;C0031809;C1292856;C1514893;C0221423;C0012634;C0012634;C0012634;C0205082;C0032074;C0003123;C3245488;C0235394;C1442065;C0012634;C3844638;C1305866;C0205082;C0001721;C0018270;C0018270;C0566415;C0015967;C0013604;C1546725;C1299581;C1114365;C0009253;C1830482;C3272565;C1561542;C1561542;C3534109;C3534109;C0728735;C0031809,C0041667;C0205082,20080601,,,Completed,21505367,1,1.0,0.031490298974886,0.027435887082582,Age 6 - 24 months;;;;;;;;;;Either sex;;;;;;;;;;Severely malnourished [weight for age (WA) < -3 Z score];;;;;;;;;;Resolution of acute illnesses;;;;;;;;;;Not planning to leave the current residence within next six months (for the purpose of             follow-up);;;;;;;;;;Informed consent granted from the guardian.,"Persistent anorexia, fever, severe wasting (WH < -3 Z score) or edema;;;;;;;;;;Clinically apparent congenital/acquired disorders that may affect growth;;;;;;;;;;Other acute or chronic diseases requiring hospitalization and/or affecting growth;;;;;;;;;;Lack of fixed address (to avoid difficulties in tracing for follow up examinations);;;;;;;;;;Caregiver's condition: children accompanied by caregivers who are not able to give any             time for child care or unable to give stimulation due to any condition e.g. old age,             disease, physical or mental handicap.",1,3,0,1,2,0,0,1,1,1

The study builds on the recent approach of      training mothers to screen for acute malnutrition in their own children (mother MUAC      approach).      The primary aim of the study is to describe and compare the performance of a set of three      prototype Click-MUAC devices against a gold standard of classification, in terms of measures      of agreement (sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, Cohen's Kappa, Youden's J) for the      classification (diagnosis) of acute malnutrition.

According to prior studies, malnutrition affects about      15-30 % of hospitalized children in Europe (ESPGHAN 2005, Pawellek et al 2008, Joosten and      Hulst 2008). However, available criteria for defining malnutrition in paediatric patients are      inconsistent, not based on firm evidence, and not generally agreed upon. Current guidelines      do not address assessment of and screening for childhood malnutrition. Therefore, a large      number of affected children are not adequately diagnosed.      One aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of malnutrition and patients at risk for      malnutrition among at least 2700 hospitalized children mainly across Europe. In addition      criteria to link anthropometric measurements and the prediction of outcome, i.e. length of      hospital stay, shall be established. A further goal then is to establish agreed,      evidence-based criteria for malnutrition in children with the purpose of leading to an      agreed, evidence-based screening tool for paediatric malnutrition in developed countries.      This tool shall include a set of simple questions, based on previously suggested tools.
