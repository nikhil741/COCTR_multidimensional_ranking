For the National Institutes of Health (NIH)/US site: HIV-1 infection, as                  documented by OraQuick rapid test using venipuncture whole blood, or fingerstick                  whole blood done at screening; or by reactive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay                  (ELISA) and Western Blot as determined by NIH Clinical Pathology Laboratory or                  Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc. Monitoring Laboratory. HIV infection as                  determined by an outside Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments                  (CLIA)-approved laboratory facility"" will be accepted for enrollment and verified                  by a standard HIV-1 ELISA with Western Blot at NIH.                  For Keny Medical Research Institute/Walter Reed Project Clinical Research Center                  (KEMRI/WRP CRC)/Kenya site: HIV-1 infection will initially be diagnosed based                  upon two, serial rapid HIV tests according to Kenya Ministry of Health (MOH)                  guidelines. Volunteers entering this study will have HIV infection confirmed by                  two serial rapid HIV test in accordance with Kenya MOH guidelines and testing                  algorithm followed by a confirmation with a Western Blot using FDA approved-kits.                  Samples from participants with discrepant results (between the results from other                  institution and KEMRI/WRP-CRC laboratory) and/or indeterminate/negative Western                  Blot will be subjected to a nucleic acid assay i.e. DNA or RNA PCR. For Thailand,                  HIV-1 screening and confirmatory testing will be based on 3, HIV tests according                  to the Thai Ministry of Public Health guidelines. The subjects will initially be                  tested with a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) method that                  detects both HIV antigen and antibody. Confirmatory testing of HIV reactive                  samples by two different antibody detection methods will follow. Positive results                  by all three methods confirm HIV diagnosis. Discrepancy between the tests will                  require a nucleic acid detection method to confirm HIV diagnosis.               2. No previous treatment with potent combination anti-retroviral therapy (ART),                  defined as any protease inhibitor (PI)-based or non-nucleoside reverse                  transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based regimen, or even triple nucleoside reverse                  transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI)-based regimen, consisting of at least three                  antiretroviral drugs (including a boosted PI with NNRTI combination). Patients                  with limited use of ART (less than 12 weeks duration) more than 24 weeks before                  screening will be eligible for study participation.               3. Screening CD4+ cell count less than or equal to 100 cells/mm(3). * Note: CD4 <                  100 cells/microL from an outside or the site s laboratory within 8 weeks prior to                  screening can be accepted as the screening value.               4. Residence within the wider Washington D.C. area (approximately within a 120-mile                  radius from the NIH Bethesda campus) for the National Institutes of Health/US                  site and residents of the Kericho District Hospital catchment area, an                  approximate 93-mile (150 kilometers) radius, for the KEMRI/WRP CRC/Kenya site.                  Residence within the Bangkok Metropolitan area and nearby provinces are allowed                  to participate (approximately 120-mile radius from each of the clinical sites)               5.

Be willing to allow storage of blood or tissue samples for future research. (For                  Thailand: storage of blood or tissue samples is an optional procedure and                  therefore not a inclusion criteria)               8. Be willing to have HLA testing. (For Thailand: HLA testing is an optional                  procedure and therefore not an inclusion criteria)               9. For the NIH/US site: Participants should have a primary care physician or will                  need to agree to find one during the first 24-48 weeks on study. For the                  KEMRI/WRP/Kenya site: Participants must be enrolled in the Kericho District                  Hospital HIV Clinic. For the two Thailand clinical sites: participants must be                  enrolled in the HIV clinic at either of the sites.        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:          1. Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the investigator,             would interfere with adherence to study requirements.          2. Pregnancy will be an exclusion criterion for study entry given the intense nature of             the protocol regarding blood draws, diagnostic testing, and follow-up.","This study will investigate what factors may lead to the development of immune reconstitution      syndrome (IRIS) in HIV-infected patients and what the outcome is after IRIS. It will also      seek to better define and describe the syndrome. IRIS is a condition that can occur in      HIV-infected people following the start of antiretroviral therapy. The sudden improvement of      immune function with this therapy can cause an unexpected worsening of diseases the patient      already has, such as tuberculosis or fungal infections, and development of fever, enlarged      lymph nodes or other complications, or even uncover a previously silent disease.      HIV-infected people who are at least 18 years old, whose CD4+T cell count is 100 cells per      microliter or less, and who have not previously been treated with combination antiretroviral      therapy or have taken the drugs for less than 3 months and more than 6 months before      screening for this study may be eligible to participate. Candindates must also live within      the wider DC area so that acute problems after therapy initiation will be evaluated at NIH.      Candidates are evaluated before starting therapy with a medical history and physical      examination, blood and urine tests, electrocardiogram, chest x-ray and CT scan of the chest,      tuberculin skin testing, apheresis, and possibly an intestinal (gut) and lymph node biopsy      (surgical removal of a small piece of tissue for microscopic examination). For apheresis,      blood is collected through a needle in an arm vein and spun in a machine that separates the      blood components. The white blood cells and plasma are removed, and the red cells and      platelets are returned through the same needle or through a needle in a vein in the other      arm.      Participants have a complete history and physical examination and additional blood tests,      including genetic studies, upon entering the study. They start taking anti-HIV medications,      prescribed according to the current standard of care, as well as medications to treat other      infections, and treatment of IRIS, if needed. The study lasts about 4 years. Patients return      to the clinic at 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks after the entry visit, then every 12 weeks (about every      3 months) until week 48 (the first year), and then every 16 weeks (about every 4 months)      until the end of the study.

CD4+ T cells are a subset of lymphocytes-white blood cells that are part of the      body's immune system. IL-2 is a protein that is naturally produced by lymphocytes. Given in      intermittent cycles, IL-2 can raise CD4+ T cell counts in some HIV-infected patients taking      antiretroviral drugs. This study will examine whether the increase in CD4+ T cells lowers the      risk of AIDS-related illnesses and death.      HIV-infected patients 18 years of age and older with a viral load under 10,000 copies per      milliliter and a CD4+ T cell count between 50 and 299 cells per cubic millimeter who are      taking antiretroviral therapy and who have not previously received IL-2 therapy may be      eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history, physical      examination, and blood and urine tests. Participation in the study will be from 4.5 to 6      years, depending on what point in the duration of the study the individual patient is      enrolled.      Patients will be randomly assigned to receive IL-2 plus ART or ART alone. All participants      will be advised individually about the best ART regimen for them. Patients in the IL-2      treatment group will be taught how to self-inject IL-2 under the skin (similar to insulin      injections). They will inject IL-2 twice a day for 5 days every 8 weeks for the first year      (until week 49 of the study). From week 49 on they may receive 5-day cycles of IL-2 every 4      months when needed to maintain CD4+ T cell count elevations. An extra cycle may be given 2      months after the week 49 follow-up visit (see follow-up schedule below), depending on their      CD4+ T cell count. Patients whose cell counts have not increased after 12 to 16 months of      IL-2 treatment will discuss with the doctor the possibility of stopping IL-2. Those who do      stop IL-2 treatment will be asked to remain in the study for follow-up evaluations.      All patients will be followed in the clinic every 2 months for the first year of the study      (weeks 1, 9, 17, 25, 33, 41 and 49) and every 4 months during years 2-6 for a brief history      and physical exam, urine and blood tests, return of diary cards (record of drug side effects)      and medication review.

The molecular,      cellular, and pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the HIV-associated immune activation      are complex and still poorly studied. There is, however, growing consensus that both viral      and host factors contribute to this phenotype, with emphasis on the role played by the      mucosal immune dysfunction (and consequent microbial translocation). Moreover if it is known      that in HIV-infected individuals, a severe depletion of intestinal cluster of differentiation      4 (CD4+) T-cells, is associated with loss of epithelium integrity, microbial translocation      and systemic immune activation, the kinetics of intestinal CD4+ T-cell reconstitution under      combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) remains poorly understood.      This study sought to evaluate the reconstitution of intestinal CD4+ T-cells, including Th1      and Th17, in blood and colon samples collected from HIV-infected individuals before and after      a short term cART.",HIV infection;GUT;microbial translocation;chronic inflammation;antiretroviral therapy;cART;HAART;Th17;Th1;CD4+;,Virus Diseases;Bacterial Infections and Mycoses;Immune System Diseases;,C1963724;C0021853;C2004454;C0439663;C0947630;C0007584,C1963724;C0019693;C0021853;C1705273;C0439663;C0439662;C0007584;C0021853;C1561514,C1963724;C1511938;C0019693;C0242656;C0277785;C0021853;C0021853;C0021853;C1285572;C0178539;C0439663;C0439663;C0947630;C0439662;C0439662;C0600138;C0439662;C0205082;C0439662;C0947630;C0005767;C0009368;C1704326;C4067746;C3845876;C0162340;C1328018;C1512793;C0220825;C0939261;C0277785,C0021051,C0021851;C0742766;C0003280;C0009378;C0162791;C0013227;C0006826;C0190979;C0087111;C0087111;C0032961;C0012634;C0262512;C0439662;C0002871;C1552850;C1561542;C1301624;C0442743;C0562357;C0001617,,20141201,,,Unknown status,25340778,13,13.0,0.025707828553567003,0.022999404379383,na├»ve for antiretroviral treatment;;;;;;;;;;met the criteria to start cART according to International Guidelines;;;;;;;;;;written informed consent signed,"treatment with glucocorticosteroids and any immune modulating medication for more than             seven days in the previous month;;;;;;;;;;any past or current systemic malignancy, history of inflammatory diseases of the small             or large intestine;;;;;;;;;;pregnancy;;;;;;;;;;anemia, use of anticoagulants, and any contraindications to phlebotomy or colonoscopy.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

It usually occurs in subjects with impaired immune system as during      HIV infection. To date, there is no specific antiviral treatment susceptible to cure PML. But      it was shown in the setting of HIV-related PML, that combination antiretroviral therapy      allows a restoration of the immune system and then might stop the progression of PML.      The objective of this study is to appreciate the supplementary efficiency brought by an      association of more powerful antiretroviral molecules including enfuvirtide on the evolution      of PML. This research program will involve 30 patients in several centres in France. All the      patients who will participate will receive enfuvirtide during 6 months in association with a      combination of two or more potent antiretroviral drugs. The total duration of follow-up for a      patient will be of 1 year.","Leukoencephalopathy, Progressive Multifocal;HIV infections;HIV Fusion Inhibitors;",Virus Diseases;Bacterial Infections and Mycoses;Nervous System Diseases;Immune System Diseases;,C1963724;C0537439;C3843228;C0085584,C1963724;C3811910;C0087111;C0009450;C1174749;C3843228;C0085584,C1264609;C1963724;C0019693;C0449982;C0242656;C0004083;C0537439;C0537439;C0004083;C0003451;C0087111;C0018017;C1552740;C0542559;C0439662;C0439662;C0947630;C0013227;C1561543;C0023524;C0023524;C0023524;C0023524;C0023524;C3539181;C3539181;C2948499;C0023524;C2827758;C0231184;C0233492;C0332534;C1561542,C3843228,C0029118;C0011911;C0002199;C0019693;C0021083;C1522405;C0275524;C1457868;C1301725;C0750484;C0011900;C0032961;C0087111;C0286079;C0006104;C0262512;C0079595;C0027769;C0204695;C0262926;C0262926;C1519316;C0700287;C0006141;C1174749;C1174749;C0023524;C0023524;C1550557;C1550557;C0424530;C3842337;C3842337;C1320102;C3883383;C1511790;C1555709;C4697740;C3272565;C4699193,C0270612;C0949573,20071201,,,Completed,21738597,19,19.0,0.019254770504134,0.021110415460831002,18 years of age and older;;;;;;;;;;Have confirmed laboratory diagnosis of HIV infection;;;;;;;;;;Presenting with a clinical history of active PML evolving (or continuing to             deteriorate) for less than 90 days;;;;;;;;;;Diagnosis of PML documented for less than 30 days at the inclusion by cerebral imaging             (MRI) AND the absence of another demonstrated etiology AND the detection of JCV DNA in             the CSF by qualitative PCR.;;;;;;;;;;Signed written inform consent,"Concomitant opportunistic infection of the central nervous system;;;;;;;;;;Pregnancy, breast-feeding;;;;;;;;;;Co-infection by the HIV2;;;;;;;;;;History of immunotherapy including interleukin-2 and alpha-interferon;;;;;;;;;;History of treatment by FUZEON┬« or by cidofovir;;;;;;;;;;Contra-indication to receive FUZEON",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMZ), also known as bactrim, is a common antibiotic and      used as prophylaxis for OIs. For countries with high prevalence of HIV and limited health      infrastructure, the WHO endorses universal TMP/SMZ for all HIV-infected individuals. Notably,      these guidelines were created prior to the scale-up of ARTs. Following ART and subsequent      immune recovery, TMP/SMZ may no longer be required. In the US and Europe, for example,      TMP/SMZ is discontinued after patients show evidence of immune recovery. Therefore, we      propose a prospective randomized trial among HIV infected individuals on ART with evidence of      immune recovery (ART for > 18mo and CD4 >350 cells/mm3) to determine whether continued      TMP/SMZ prophylaxis confers benefits in decreasing morbidity (malaria, pneumonia, diarrhea),      mortality, CD4 count maintenance, ART treatment failure and malaria immune responses.",HIV;Co-Infections;Malaria;Pneumonia;Diarrhea;,"Respiratory Tract Diseases;Immune System Diseases;Parasitic Diseases;Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;Virus Diseases;Bacterial Infections and Mycoses;",C1963724;C0038689;C1444662;C0041041;C0199176,C1963724;C0038689;C1444662;C0041041;C0199176;C3897779,C0029118;C1963724;C0162643;C0038689;C0041041;C0199176;C0199176;C0199176;C0003232;C0162791;C0442797;C0442797;C4316796;C0220880;C0032285;C1561565;C0439663;C0439663;C3245501;C0439663;C0011991;C0591139;C0024530;C0024530;C3245511;C0439662;C0439662;C0439662;C0439662;C0175659;C1273517;C0029118;C0029118;C1704632;C2004454;C2004454;C2004454;C1444662;C4699274;C4331837;C0018792;C3834249;C4082977;C1444662,C0021051;C0012634;C0009450;C0008533,C0162643;C0006147;C1516879;C1516879;C0162791;C1561565;C0549206;C0600109;C0600109;C0392366;C0087111;C0042036;C1299581;C0589121;C0086960;C0009797;C4684637;C4699274;C1561542,,20131001,,,Completed,30897090;28077587;26731191,8,2.6666666666666696,0.018082493331836005,0.017501870505318002,Participants must be at least 18 years of age.;;;;;;;;;;Participants must be willing to participate and give written informed consent.;;;;;;;;;;Participants must be willing and able to return for the scheduled follow-up visits.;;;;;;;;;;Participants must have been on ART for > 18 months.;;;;;;;;;;Participants must have a CD4 count of > 350 cells/mm;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Participants must not be suspected of ART treatment failure.,Participants must not be pregnant at enrollment (by urine HCG testing).;;;;;;;;;;Participants must not be breastfeeding at the time of enrollment.;;;;;;;;;;Participants must be on first-line ART therapy as defined by Kenyan National             Guidelines.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

However,      metabolic, skeletal, and cardiovascular diseases have been increasingly reported among      HIV-infected patients and may be attributable, in part, to the direct effects of cART.

Secondary hypotheses are that recovery of pathogen specific cellular immunity directed at C.      neoformans, as manifested by increases in the number and function of C. neoformans-specific      peripheral blood mononuclear cells is associated with 1) ART and 2) pathogen clearance. In      addition, patients randomized to the intervention arm will have more rapid clearance of      antigen levels in CSF and serum and will have a lower incidence of grade 3 and 4 Adverse      events.",HIV-1;Africa;Botswana;Highly active antiretroviral therapy;treatment naive;,Virus Diseases;Bacterial Infections and Mycoses;Nervous System Diseases;Immune System Diseases;,C0085436;C1963724;C0439663,C0206034;C0085436;C1963724;C2828392;C0439663;C1697779,C0206034;C1963724;C0007806;C0020966;C0229664;C0430420;C0184661;C0589507;C0025289;C0003308;C0087111;C2828392;C0439663;C1552740;C0031843;C1552740;C0687697;C0229671;C0018017;C0446516;C0442797;C2004454;C1513475;C1382187;C1382187;C0027627;C1382187;C1382187;C0009368;C4522152;C0700287,,C0085436;C0085436;C0085437;C0001551;C0002423;C0001617;C0002679;C0002679;C0002679;C0006147;C0392920;C0392920;C1516879;C0031809;C1516879;C0031809;C1516879;C0003308;C0031809;C1516879;C0031809;C1516879;C0009450;C0750484;C0750484;C0184666;C0123471;C0012621;C0549206;C0087111;C0087111;C0006826;C0332148;C0947630;C1561542;C0947630;C1561540;C0001551;C0009797;C3827727;C0376705;C0392751;C3641827;C4331837;C4331837;C4331837;C1548573;C0599990;C3843408;C3843408;C0427184,C1320102,20111201,,,Completed,23362285,23,23.0,0.032902224620459,0.018330040105331003,"HIV 1 infection confirmed by licensed ELISA kit and/or detectable Viral load.;;;;;;;;;;Confirmed Cryptococcal meningitis on the current admission by India ink or CSF             cryptococcal antigen;;;;;;;;;;ART naive at the time of enrollment;;;;;;;;;;21 years old and above;;;;;;;;;;Ability and willingness to give written informed consent to participate in the study;;;;;;;;;;Able (as assessed by the patient's medical team)to initiate amphotericin B for             cryptococcal meningitis;;;;;;;;;;Initiated amphotericin B 72 hours or less prior to assessment for enrollment or not on             amphotericin B at the time of assessment for enrollment;;;;;;;;;;Agrees to obtain outpatient care after discharge within 50 kilometers from Princess             Marina Hospital,Scottish Livingstone Hospital and Bamalete Lutheran Hospital","Recent (within the past 4 weeks) antifungal use;;;;;;;;;;Pregnant or breastfeeding;;;;;;;;;;Initiated anti-tubercular therapy 2 weeks or less prior to assessment for enrollment.;;;;;;;;;;Bacterial meningitis at the time of assessment for enrollment.;;;;;;;;;;Recent (within the past 1 month) use of the following:systemic cancer             chemotherapy,oral or intravenous corticosteroids or other immunomodulators.;;;;;;;;;;Judged by study coordinator to be likely to initiate chemotherapy or any other             immunomodulatory therapy prior to the 4 week LP.;;;;;;;;;;Imprisoned.",2,0,0,0,3,3,1,3,0,4

Data suggest that aggressive management of HIV infection, which includes      Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART) during treatment of TB, decreases both morbidity and      mortality. On the other hand, the use of HAART for patients with TB may cause severe      complications due to drug-drug interactions, and occasionally a temporary exacerbation of      symptoms. These reactions may be particularly severe when HAART is started soon after the      start of TB treatment.      The proposed study aims to determine the optimal time to initiate HAART in previously      untreated HIV-infected adult patients with TB and low CD4 cell counts.",HIV infection;Tuberculosis;Paradoxical reaction;Treatment Naive;,Virus Diseases;Bacterial Infections and Mycoses;Immune System Diseases;,C1963724;C0041296;C0439663;C1550655,C1963724;C0041296;C0439663;C1550655,C1963724;C0687133;C0021051;C0019693;C0009566;C0041296;C0007584;C0376636;C0009450;C0087111;C0220880;C3245481;C0087111;C0332155;C0439663;C0205082;C0205082;C0887947;C0887947;C0887947;C1552850;C0947630;C0887947;C0018563;C0013227;C1550472;C1457887;C4086268;C1547300;C0000828;C0442797;C4082977,C1609538,C0032976;C0225778;C0018061;C0700589;C0006147;C0456984;C0007584;C0024204;C1301725;C0087111;C0025320;C4255373;C0032961;C0674428;C0009450;C1446409;C1446409;C0012621;C0205160;C0723457;C3858758;C0205160;C0549206;C0031843;C0442711;C0021359;C0025663;C0205054;C0022346;C0038056;C0009653;C1553386;C1299582;C0947630;C0444186;C0015733;C0005767;C1561540;C1442948;C1114365;C4699613;C4055542;C0543467;C0856882;C4331837;C4331837;C0018792;C4699275;C0750558;C3843408;C4035633,,20100501,,,Completed,24759827;24096631,39,19.5,0.033907341253286,0.027184449577457998,"Age 18 or over;;;;;;;;;;Positive HIV test result;;;;;;;;;;CD4+ cell count under or equal to 200 cells per ml within 14 days prior the study             entry;;;;;;;;;;Positive AFB on any smear (sputum, lymph node drainage, stool, CSF, pleural fluid);;;;;;;;;;Naive to ART;;;;;;;;;;TB treatment started less than one week prior enrolment;;;;;;;;;;Negative gonadotrophin pregnancy test (blood) for women of childbearing potential             (i.e. not surgically sterile or less than 2 years menopause);;;;;;;;;;Agreement from female candidates who are participating in sexual activity that could             lead to pregnancy while receiving and for 6 weeks after stopping efavirenz to use two             reliable methods of contraception, one of which including condom.","Suspected TB with negative AFB;;;;;;;;;;Pregnant or breastfeeding women;;;;;;;;;;Impaired hepatic function (icterus, elevated AST or ALT at least 5 times over the             normal value);;;;;;;;;;Unable and/or unlikely to comprehend and/or be adherent to the protocol;;;;;;;;;;Treated for a previous suspected or documented TB other than the ongoing infection             which motivates enrolment in this trial",0,0,0,0,4,1,0,1,0,1

This phase II trial is to determine precisely the pharmacokinetics parameters of RBT in      combination with different ART regimens in Vietnamese HIV infected patients with pulmonary      tuberculosis, in order to define optimal doses that will be further tested in a larger phase      III trial comparing safety, tolerability and efficacy of RBT and RMP regimens.",HIV;Tuberculosis;Rifabutin;Pharmacokinetics;South Africa;,Virus Diseases;Bacterial Infections and Mycoses;Immune System Diseases;,C1963724;C0031327;C0275524;C0140575;C1550655,C1963724;C0031327;C0019693;C0041296;C0140575;C0087111;C1550655,C1963724;C0009429;C0031327;C0019693;C0041296;C0041296;C0035139;C0035608;C0140575;C0857127;C0024109;C0439663;C2945654;C0439663;C2945654;C1518681;C4684637;C0392366;C0013227;C3539181;C4084912;C0018792;C1522411;C0018792;C0220825;C4082977,C0021051,C0041327;C0013182;C0023901;C0011849;C1301624;C0032976;C0004936;C0009871;C0085762;C0392920;C1550700;C0392920;C0013227;C0027947;C0013227;C0162340;C1561565;C0206065;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0206065;C0012634;C1446409;C1446409;C0003241;C0205160;C0442711;C0549206;C0332149;C0687697;C0262926;C0262926;C0087111;C0087111;C0002871;C0687696;C0700164;C0038056;C0944911;C0566415;C0947630;C0013227;C0947630;C0013227;C1273517;C0013227;C0013227;C1561540;C0587081;C1555587;C0009797;C0233492;C0009450;C2828358;C0332534;C1561542;C0018792;C0018792;C0018792;C3534109;C3843502;C3272565;C0282547;C4699193;C4699193;C4698129,,20101001,,,Completed,26482301;25406657,8,4.0,0.023561115595467003,0.026272034522990997,Pulmonary tuberculosis (proven by AFB positive sputum or culture);;;;;;;;;;Having completed and adhered to 6 wks of intensive phase TB chemotherapy;;;;;;;;;;Positive HIV antibody and CD4 count >50 /mm3 and <=200;;;;;;;;;;Weight > 50 kg;;;;;;;;;;No ART in the preceding 3 months;;;;;;;;;;No more than 2 weeks or ART previously;;;;;;;;;;No grade 3 or 4 clinical or laboratory findings;;;;;;;;;;Negative pregnancy test and appropriate contraceptive measures during the duration of             the trial for female of childbearing age;;;;;;;;;;Having a firm home address that is readily accessible;;;;;;;;;;Karnofsky score>=80%,"History of TB within the 3 years preceding the presenting episode of TB;;;;;;;;;;Previous treatment for MDR TB;;;;;;;;;;Concomitant OI requiring additional anti-infectious treatment;;;;;;;;;;Formal contraindication to any drug used in the trial;;;;;;;;;;Diabetes mellitus requiring drug treatment;;;;;;;;;;Recreational drug or alcohol abuse;;;;;;;;;;History of drug hypersensitivity to TB or related medications;;;;;;;;;;Interrupted TB therapy for more than 1 week;;;;;;;;;;Less than 90% adherent to first 6 weeks of intensive phase chemotherapy;;;;;;;;;;Mental illness that could impair ability to give informed consent or result in poor             adherence to trial protocol and therapy;;;;;;;;;;Neutropenia <1200 /L, anaemia <6.8 g/dL, liver function test > grade 2;;;;;;;;;;Requiring concomitant medications that may potentially interact with study drugs;;;;;;;;;;Pregnant or lactating women;;;;;;;;;;Karnofsky score >80%;;;;;;;;;;Any condition rendering the patient unable to understand the nature, scope, and             possible consequences of thes study and to provide consent",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1
