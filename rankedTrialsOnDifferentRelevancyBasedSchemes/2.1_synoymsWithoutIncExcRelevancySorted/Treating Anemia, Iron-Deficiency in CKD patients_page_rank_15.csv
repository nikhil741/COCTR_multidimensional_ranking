The impact of severe      IDA can have mortal consequences, since without adequate hemoglobin, the brain and body      become deprived of oxygen and, if allowed to continue, death may ensue. It has been shown      that iron supplementation in infants and young children can enhance child development,      however, it may also result in increased rates of malaria in high burden areas.      The primary objective of this study is to determine the impact of providing encapsulated iron      (as a powder added to complementary foods) on the susceptibility to clinical malaria among      anemic and non-anemic infants and young children (6-24 months of age) living in a high      malaria burden area.
