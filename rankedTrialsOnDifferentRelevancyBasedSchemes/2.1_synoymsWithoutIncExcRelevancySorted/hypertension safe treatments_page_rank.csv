Examination of the fundus: Grade III and Grade IV","Resistant hypertension (ReHy) is an emerging clinical and public health problem which tends      to increase because populations are living longer and there is a growing global epidemic of      obesity, diabetes and sleep apnea. It is also tempting to speculate that the excessive      dietary salt ingestion reported in many countries can contribute substantially to the risk of      ReHy development. ReHy is defined as persistent high blood pressure (above the target goal)      in spite of the use of at least 3 antihypertensive agents of different classes, one of them      must being diuretics.      Data regarding the exact prevalence of ReHy are very limited. In addition, little data is      available about 3-drug combinations but a simplified treatment algorithm has demonstrated      that a combination of a diuretic plus an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or      an angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB) plus diuretic, adding a calcium channel blocker when      necessary, controlled 64% of hypertensive patients and, in addition, was even more efficient      than the current guideline-based management. By contrast, the fourth drug to be added-on the      triple regimen is still controversial and guided by empirical choices or personal      preferences. Recent studies suggest the emerging role of spironolactone as the ""first-line""      fourth drug for treating resistant hypertension. Conversely, because of the      pathophysiological rationale, others have proposed the use of β-blockers or even centrally      acting agents for managing the sympathetic hyperactivity. The present concerns about the      limited blood pressure reducing effect of β-blockers, especially in elderly people, the      potent effect of centrally acting agents and our personal experience are pointing to      clonidine as the fourth drug to be added-on to a multidrug combination for reaching optimal      blood pressure in patients with ReHy. Nevertheless, no studies have been performed comparing,      head-to-head, which one is the best fourth drug (spironolactone or clonidine) to be added-on      to a common used multidrug combination in order to treat this condition.      Therefore, the principal objectives of the ReHOT Trial are to assess prospectively: (1) the      prevalence of ReHy in a cohort of outpatients with stage II hypertension; (2) the effect of      spironolactone on blood pressure, in comparison to clonidine, when added to a multidrug      combination consisting of chlorthalidone plus ACEi (or ARB) plus amlodipine, all of 3      up-titrated to the highest dose; (3) the role of measuring sympathetic nervous system      activity and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone activity on predicting the response of blood      pressure to spironolactone and clonidine.",Resistant Hypertension;,Cardiovascular Diseases;,C0020538;C1514892;C0087111,C0020792;C0020538;C0087111;C1514892;C1550655;C0947630;C1550655,C0003364;C0006684;C0020538;C0014432;C0037982;C0005823;C0005823;C0037982;C0037982;C0005823;C0008294;C0037982;C0699943;C0424295;C0020538;C3539181;C0857121;C0020538;C0020538;C0037315;C0243107;C0003018;C0003018;C0003018;C0002006;C0376636;C0237607;C0018017;C0051696;C1514892;C0012798;C0087111;C0002045;C0282423;C0009014;C0009014;C0012634;C0009014;C0009014;C0011849;C0700287;C0012798;C0012798;C1704632;C0460139;C0033213;C0028754;C0456387;C0040808;C0947630;C0150312;C0947630;C0027769;C3539125;C1518681;C1518681;C3245511;C1518681;C1300072;C0005767;C0037494;C0018017;C3245479;C0013227;C1704326;C0013227;C0013227;C0018670;C0018670;C0013227;C1273517;C1704326;C3539181;C3539181;C3539181;C3539181;C3845947;C4684637;C0776963;C1979715;C1514811;C2911690;C3653883;C1514892;C0449900;C0776963;C0776963;C0776963;C1522411;C0776963;C4697740;C0037816;C1707944;C3272565;C1707944;C1548344;C0201956;C4049938;C4049938;C3834249;C0277785;C0546816,C0020538,C0189573;C0871470;C0488055;C0018824;C1320716;C0948807;C0442867;C0277814;C0183427;C0020517;C0018801;C0700589;C0020538;C1548428;C0003811;C0031809;C0162791;C0001973;C0221423;C0032961;C0450094;C4684790;C0442711;C0004245;C4050001;C1550655;C0262926;C0542560;C0262512;C0038454;C0740422;C0022646;C0456387;C0013227;C0947630;C2948499;C0593946;C1550655;C1550655;C1550655;C4699613;C0332448;C3714738;C0012000;C0238815;C1561542;C1300072;C0016590,C0020538;C1514892,20140701,,,Unknown status,29463627;24338935,7,3.5,0.028322062248558,0.026573656894232,"Patients aged between 18 and 75;;;;;;;;;;With systolic blood pressure> 160 mmHg and <220mmHg and / or diastolic> 100 mmHg in             the sitting position and according to Brazilian Guidelines on Hypertension (perform             steps by obtaining two consecutive measurements differing by less than 4 mmHg between             them, calibrated using a sphygmomanometer);;;;;;;;;;Patient regularly enrolled in participating center","Systolic blood pressure> 220 mmHg;;;;;;;;;;Patients with cardiovascular events (stroke, AMI, etc.). or cardiovascular procedures             with less than 6 months of evolution;;;;;;;;;;Renal stages IV and V (glomerular20 filtration estimated by MDRD formula <30 ml / min;             where MDRD = 186 x (S_Cr) -1.154 x (age) -0.203 x (0.742 if fem.) x (1.210 if             Afro-amer. ));;;;;;;;;;Heart failure class III and IV;;;;;;;;;;History of malignant disease with life expectancy < 2 years;;;;;;;;;;Alcoholism;;;;;;;;;;Psychiatric illnesses that prevent compliance with the Protocol;;;;;;;;;;Women of childbearing age who are not in use of effective contraception;;;;;;;;;;Pregnancy;;;;;;;;;;Arrhythmias, valvular heart disease, AV block 2 and 3 degrees without MP;;;;;;;;;;Hepatic impairment;;;;;;;;;;Patients with a history of hypersensitivity to any of the drugs under study;;;;;;;;;;Examination of the fundus: Grade III and Grade IV",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The study will be a randomised placebo-controlled      double-blind crossover comparison of an α-blocker (α), β-blocker (β), and K+-sparing diuretic      (∆).      Patients will have a BP at entry above target on ABPM or home monitoring despite supervised      administration of maximum tolerated doses of A+C+D. Over 48 weeks they will then receive, in      random order either placebo or two doses each of doxazosin (α), bisoprolol (β) or      spironolactone (∆). Each treatment cycle will last 12 weeks, with a forced dose-doubling at 6      weeks.      The time course for the study will be similar to study one. 340 patients will provide 90%      power, at α=0.01 to detect a 3 mmHg overall difference in home sBP between any one drug and      placebo, with spironolactone hypothesized to be best overall. The study will be able to      detect a 6 mmHg difference in sBP between each subject's best and second-best drug predicted      by tertile of plasma renin, justifying routine use of the measurement in patients with      resistant hypertension.",Hypertension;,Cardiovascular Diseases;,C0020538;C0087111;C1514892;C0013227,C0020538;C0087111;C1514892;C0013227,C1533734;C0037982;C0037982;C0020538;C0020538;C0020538;C0150369;C0053799;C0087111;C0087111;C0114873;C0087111;C0150600;C3245501;C0012798;C0032042;C0032042;C0032042;C0442726;C0442726;C0032105;C0947630;C0947630;C0456909;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0013227;C1299581;C0013227;C1550655;C1555587;C1555587;C0085632;C0085632;C2911690;C0202165;C1514892;C1514892;C1522411;C0056685,C0085616,C0020540;C0013230;C1320716;C0004975;C0004238;C0003364;C0011854;C0019993;C0008679;C0001617;C0001617;C0039052;C0700589;C0282374;C0020538;C0020538;C0020538;C0039771;C3840775;C0231199;C4284141;C0013227;C0000970;C0013227;C0065374;C0051696;C0051696;C0065374;C0138547;C0138547;C0002771;C0031809;C0257343;C0241863;C0087111;C0199230;C0199230;C0032821;C0199230;C0032961;C0087111;C0012634;C0087111;C0199230;C0087111;C0087111;C0199230;C0199230;C0199230;C0199230;C0033572;C0241863;C0683312;C0032074;C0205082;C0443343;C3245501;C0087111;C0087111;C1547296;C0004057;C1547296;C0032105;C1553386;C0006826;C0332148;C0001721;C0003211;C0003211;C0025344;C0013227;C0013227;C0013227;C1527305;C0013227;C1512346;C1512346;C1512346;C0947630;C0947630;C0013227;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C1512346;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0439095;C0013227;C1561540;C0013227;C1561540;C1273517;C1561540;C0175201;C1550472;C1561538;C1561538;C0600140;C0857121;C0012634;C1550655;C1550655;C1550655;C1550655;C1550655;C1550655;C1457887;C1552867;C0009797;C0182285;C4684637;C2911690;C4048188;C4048188;C0745348;C0027627;C0012000;C1561542;C1561542;C1706074;C1512346;C1706074;C1706074;C1512346;C4331837;C2702329;C0018792;C0018792;C4331837;C4331837;C4331837;C4331837;C0580105;C0031638;C1553756;C0260026;C2732140;C1995642;C4086490;C0728774;C1995642;C0728774;C3272565;C1995642;C4283785;C1301624;C4699193;C0231199;C4698129;C4698129,C0020538,20150801,,,Unknown status,29655877;26414968;26253568,88,29.3333333333333,0.023871948147998,0.02085188111875,"M/F 18-79 years;;;;;;;;;;Patients with hypertension not controlled to target: clinic systolic BP ΓëÑ 5 mmHg above             target (i.e. ΓëÑ 140 mmHg for non-diabetic hypertensives or ΓëÑ 135 mmHg for diabetics),             under one of the following conditions:;;;;;;;;;;Treatment for at least 3 months with lisinopril 20 mg (A) + amlodipine 10 mg (C)                  + bendroflumethiazide 2.5 mg (D) or their equivalents;;;;;;;;;;Patients who have received the three drugs or equivalents specified in a), and                  are either intolerant to one category, or tolerate only a lower dose (e.g.                  amlodipine 5 mg or lisinopril 10 mg);;;;;;;;;;Patients receiving the three drugs or equivalents specified in a), who are                  receiving additional drugs for their hypertension, may be included if the                  investigator: 1) feels it is appropriate to stop these additional drugs at the                  screening visit and 2) anticipates that the BP criteria for inclusion will be met                  when re-checked at the baseline visit Patients may be included if the PI                  anticipates BP criteria for inclusion will be met at randomisation.;;;;;;;;;;Patients with a home systolic BP average of >130 mmHg or within 15mmHg of clinic BP             over the 4 days prior to the baseline visit.","Inability to give informed consent;;;;;;;;;;;Participation in a clinical study involving an investigational drug or device within 4             weeks of screening;;;;;;;;;;;Secondary or accelerated hypertension;;;;;;;;;;;Type 1 diabetes;;;;;;;;;;;eGFR<45 mls/min;;;;;;;;;;;Plasma potassium outside of normal range on two successive measurements during             screening;;;;;;;;;;;Pregnancy, planning to conceive, or women of child-bearing potential not taking             adequate contraception;;;;;;;;;;Anticipated change of medical status during the trial -

Known renal insufficiency with a concentration of creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dl","The working hypothesis for the present study is that treatment with CPAP in patients with an      sleep apnea (IAH>15) and AHT-r is capable of producing significant reductions in      blood-pressure levels.      This hypothesis is supported by four proven findings:        1. -sleep apnea is an independent risk factor for arterial hypertension (1).        2. -The greater the number of RSD, the greater the loss of control over blood-pressure           levels (1).        3. -The prevalence of sleep apnea in patients with AHT refractory to treatment is very high           (11,12).        4. -Treatment of patients with sleep apnea and AHT-r with CPAP succeeds in significantly           reducing blood-pressure levels in the only (small-scale) studies undertaken to date           (14,15).      4.

There are no reports in the literature and concrete enough to elucidate      important issues, especially in the field of hypertension and pregnancy.      Searches based on current evidence concentrate their focus on the diagnosis of hypertensive      disorders and treatment of these diseases maternofetais repercussions. However, the prognosis      in the short and long term, as the BP outcome in mothers with severe preeclampsia, the most      effective treatment for the control of hypertensive crisis and metabolic and cardiovascular      events after two years of termination of pregnancy require further clarification.      The main idea for developing this research came from the clinical experience with the use of      captopril in Obstetric ICU IMIP. This drug has long been used in postpartum women with severe      preeclampsia or chronic hypertension exacerbated by pregnancy for control of hypertensive      crisis and keeping pressure levels. Following the technical standards of the institution and      during his administration, there were reports of side effects such as dry cough and nausea,      beyond the threshold dose of 150mg daily captopril was easily achieved hindering control the      use of hypotensive.      Alternative therapy, clonidine began to be used in mothers with some restriction on the use      of ACE inhibitors and its hypotensive effect for peak pressure was satisfactory. What is not      known yet is how long clonidine reduces high blood pressure and how long to leave stabilized      compared to the use of captopril.      There are no reports in the literature databases, no randomized clinical trials that prove      the effectiveness of clonidine for the treatment of hypotensive pressure peaks in this      particular group of patients, even in comparison with other classes of antihypertensive      drugs, especially captopril, to this purpose.      The investigators' primary assumption is that clonidine has better effectiveness in      decreasing the frequency of pressure peaks when compared with captopril.","captopril, clonidine, pregnancy-induced hypertension,;",Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications;Cardiovascular Diseases;,C0020538;C0009014;C0006938;C0087111,C0206034;C0020538;C4553491;C0009014;C0006938;C0087111,C0206034;C0392535;C0745114;C0341950;C0020546;C0020538;C0003364;C3887460;C1533734;C0003015;C4553491;C4553491;C0020538;C0857121;C0032914;C0857121;C0877248;C0436331;C0857353;C0857353;C0857353;C0023866;C0237607;C0184512;C0023866;C0442797;C0032961;C0032961;C0011900;C0012634;C0087111;C0033325;C0087111;C0006938;C0032961;C0038137;C0850149;C0006938;C0009014;C0009014;C0006938;C0242356;C0009014;C0087111;C0006938;C0009014;C0006938;C0012634;C0460139;C0460139;C0460139;C0460139;C0684224;C0684224;C0087111;C0684224;C0456387;C0025344;C0205082;C0231224;C0027497;C0332219;C1518681;C1300072;C1553496;C0013227;C0013227;C1273517;C1273517;C0587597;C3245501;C0030987;C1547307;C1880310;C1546848;C3539125;C3539125;C0376649;C4084912;C2707259;C2347273;C1328018;C1328018;C0700164;C0600116;C1552839;C0600116;C3272565,,C0341439;C0341439;C0020538;C1301624;C1301624;C0020517;C0020517;C0035078;C4281788;C0013227;C0037189;C0012634;C0032961;C0006938;C0009014;C1858460;C0018787;C0012634;C1548578;C0012634;C0013227;C0013227;C0013227;C1114365;C0857121,C0852036;C0006938;C0009014,20130601,,,Completed,28125624;23899372,3,1.5,0.021883787255421,0.019957876456766003,Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy;;;;;;;;;;;Postpartum;;;;;;;;;;;Age 18 to 45 years;;;;;;;;;;;Very high blood pressure,"Smoking;;;;;;;;;;;Use of illicit drugs that may interfere with maternal hemodynamics;;;;;;;;;;;Contraindications to the use of captopril: renal failure, chronic liver disease and             hypersensitivity to the drug;;;;;;;;;;;Contraindications to the use of clonidine: sinus node disease, chronic liver disease             and hypersensitivity to the drug;;;;;;;;;;;Inability to receive postpartum oral medications",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
