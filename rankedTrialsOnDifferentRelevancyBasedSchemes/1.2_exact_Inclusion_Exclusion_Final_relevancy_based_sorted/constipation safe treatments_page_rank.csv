Constipation is often associated with      impaired quality of life of the child and of great concern among parents. Despite the fact      that both diagnosis and treatment is a simple task, it is often seen that the treatment      fails, and many children are referred to a pediatric ward for specialized treatment.      There is currently little research on the subject and treatment is therefore based on expert      knowledge rather than scientific research.      The study objective is to identify the most effective and least stressful treatment of      children with constipation for both families and the health care system.      The following will be tested:      Does treatment of constipation in children require specialized knowledge and extensive      resources or can the treatment be simplified?      The results from this study are expected to form the basis for a evidence based treatment of      children with constipation.",constipation;children;outpatient;,"Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;",C0009806;C0087111;C3845694,C1273869;C0009806;C0087111;C0947630;C3897779;C3845694,C0518214;C0009806;C0009806;C0009806;C0009806;C0009806;C0086388;C0012634;C0011900;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0376554;C0018017;C0087111;C0087111;C0376554;C0087111;C0087111;C0392366;C0947630;C0947630;C3245501;C0723323;C3858576;C4055646;C1328018;C0449416;C1550488;C0220644,C0009806,C0015732;C0015732;C0199900;C0014130;C0011135;C0011135;C0021831;C0009806;C0009806;C0232721;C0009806;C0031809;C0011135;C0589507;C0000726;C0872410;C0034927;C0030193;C0012634;C0543467;C0020517;C0034896;C0015733;C0001721;C0025344;C0009368;C0013227;C1561542;C0003461;C0677505;C1550655;C3809765;C0442743;C0022396;C2707259;C0606665;C0304520,,20141001,,,Completed,26348685,1,1.0,0.078031658173965,0.050669531397627,"Children between 2 and 16 years and referral to our out patient clinic with either             constipation or fecal incontinence.;;;;;;;;;;Patients must fulfill the Rome III criteria of constipation, which mean they must have             at least 2 of the following characteristics: fewer than 3 bowel movements weekly, more             than 1 episode of fecal incontinence weekly, large stools in the rectum by digital             rectal examination or palpable on abdominal examination, occasional passing of large             stools, display of retentive posturing and withholding behavior, and painful             defecation.","Children with known organic causes of constipation, including Hirschsprungs disease,             spinal and anal congenital abnormalities, previous surgery on the colon, inflammatory             bowel disease, allergy and metabolic or endocrine diseases.;;;;;;;;;;Children receiving drugs known to affect bowel function during a 2 month period before             initiation.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
