Very hard (little balls) and/or hard stools for at least a quarter of the stools;               2. Sensation of incomplete evacuation following for at least a quarter of the                  stools;               3. Straining at defecation for at least a quarter of the time. This includes                  subjects who never have SBMs. The above criteria are only applicable for SBMs,                  i.e. BMs not preceded within a period of 24 hours by the intake of a laxative                  agent or by the use of an enema.          3. Subject agrees to stop his current laxative treatment and is willing to use rescue             medication according to the rescue rule [Dulcolax® (bisacodyl)/enemas]          4. Subject's constipation is chronic.          5. Subject is able and willing to complete the questionnaires (if a validated version in             the language of the subject is available) and the e-diary.          6. Subject voluntarily signs the written Informed Consent Form (ICF) in accordance with             the regional laws/regulations, prior to the first trial-related activity.          7. Subject is willing to adhere to all trial requirements (amongst others             colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy, if required).        Exclusion Criteria:          1. Subjects in whom constipation is thought to be drug-induced.          2. Subjects using any disallowed medication          3. Subjects suffering from secondary causes of chronic constipation, such as:             Endocrine disorders, e.g. hypopituitarism, hypothyroidism, hypercalcaemia,             pseudohypoparathyroidism, pheochromocytoma or glucagon-producing tumours, unless these             are controlled by appropriate medical therapy. Subjects with insulin-dependent             diabetes mellitus should always be excluded, also if the subjects are under             appropriate medical therapy; Metabolic disorders (e.g. porphyria, uraemia,             hypokalaemia or amyloid neuropathy, unless these are controlled by appropriate medical             therapy); Neurological disorders (e.g. Parkinson's disease, cerebral tumours,             cerebrovascular accidents, multiple sclerosis, meningocele, aganglionosis,             hypoganglionosis, hyperganglionosis, autonomic neuropathy or neuropathy due to             chemotherapy, spinal cord injury, Chaga's disease, major depression); Surgery.             Subjects with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus should always be excluded,             irrespective of whether the constipation started prior to or after the onset of             diabetes.          4. Subjects with a significant history of cancer (i.e. less than a 5-year disease-free             survival).          5. Subjects with intestinal perforation or obstruction due to structural or functional             disorder of the gut wall, obstructive ileus, severe inflammatory conditions of the             intestinal tract, such as Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis and toxic             megacolon/megarectum. Results of an endoscopy or radiologic bowel evaluation is             required to rule out polyps, cancer, stricture or other structural or organic disease:               1. For patients ≤ 50 years: a flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy after the onset                  of constipation symptoms and within the previous 5 years;               2. For patients > 50 years: a flexible sigmoidoscopy /double contrast barium enema                  or colonoscopy after the onset of constipation symptoms and within the previous 5                  years.               3. For subjects, regardless of age, even if results of this test are available                  within the previous 5 years but if the patient has alarm symptoms such as anemia,                  weight loss, heme positive stool, or rectal bleeding: a flexible sigmoidoscopy                  and double contrast barium enema or colonoscopy is needed after the onset of                  symptoms.               4. If abnormalities have been detected during the sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy e.g.,                  because of polyps, the subject can be included in the trial if the polyps were                  removed. If clinically indicated, a repeat colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy needs to be                  performed at latest within one week after the screening visit. If no barium enema                  with flexible sigmoidoscopy or a colonoscopic examination has been performed                  within the period as described above, the assessment is to be scheduled on the                  screening visit or within the week following screening. When it is clinically                  indicated that a repeat colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy is needed to confirm results of                  a colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy performed after the screening visit, the subject                  should be a screen failure.          6. Subjects with known serious illness: clinically significant cardiac, vascular, liver,             pulmonary, or psychiatric disorders (as evaluated by the Investigator).          7. Subjects with any condition that in the opinion of the Investigator would complicate             or compromise the trial or the well-being of the subject or evidence of clinically             relevant pathology that could interfere with the trial results or put the subject's             safety at risk.          8. Subjects known to have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or AIDS, hepatitis             B or hepatitis C.          9. Subjects with impaired renal function, i.e. serum creatinine concentration >180 μmol/l             or calculated creatinine clearance ≤30 ml/min, including subjects requiring dialysis.         10. Subjects with clinically significant abnormalities of haematology, urinalysis, or             blood chemistry as determined by the Investigator. If the results of the haematology,             biochemistry or urinalysis tests are not within the laboratory's reference ranges, the             subject can be included only on the condition that the Investigator judges that the             deviations are not clinically significant. This should be clearly recorded in the             electronic Case Report Form (e-CRF).         11. Subjects with a known history of alcohol or drug abuse in the previous 6 months.         12. Subjects with lactose intolerance for whom it is expected that low doses of lactose             can lead to diarrhoea, or a known allergy to ingredients or excipients of the trial             medication.         13. Subjects who received an investigational drug in the 30 days preceding the run-in             period of the trial.         14. Subjects who previously used prucalopride.","This is a multi-centre, randomised, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase      III trial to evaluate the efficacy of prucalopride versus placebo over 12 weeks of treatment      in male subjects with chronic constipation.

However, in      both the randomized and the open-label phase of the multi center trial showing this favorable      outcome, the drug produced rescue-free laxation in only about half of the patients (2). There      may be several reasons for this result, since constipation in palliative care patients often      has multiple simultaneously occurring causes.      Assuming that constipation of the non-responders is still opioid-induced, one of the possible      reasons for not responding to methylnaltrexone could be that central actions of opioids      contribute to constipation by reducing motility of the intestines through direct actions in      the spinal dorsal horn (2). However, as methylnaltrexone is a µ-receptor antagonist and not      all opioids are solely µ-receptor agonists another reason may well be that successful      laxation is determined by the receptor-profile of the specific opioid the patient is using.      Opioids do not only influence bowel functioning, but also immune system functioning and      angiogenesis. Methylnaltrexone possibly antagonizes these changes, therefore this study will      also investigate the influence of methylnaltrexone on immunologic and angiogenic parameters.","constipation, methylnaltrexone, opoid;","Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;",C0066411;C0009806;C0242402,C4084924;C0066411;C0066411;C0009806;C0022885;C0242402;C0005525;C0596087,C0011135;C0066411;C0066411;C0066411;C0066411;C0066411;C0030231;C0009806;C0085555;C0009806;C0009806;C0009806;C1519670;C0228575;C0021853;C0087111;C0332149;C0678835;C0243192;C1552740;C0542559;C0032042;C0242402;C0242402;C0242402;C0242402;C0242402;C3244286;C0242402;C0439662;C1705425;C0947630;C0013227;C3653430;C4082977;C1172713;C0700651;C0606665;C0404831;C0018792;C1328018;C1521740;C0332149;C0040597;C0040597,C0009806,C0236124;C0281548;C1268567;C0815172;C0066814;C0021831;C0066411;C0066411;C0066411;C0066411;C0066411;C0066411;C0066411;C0066411;C0066411;C0066411;C0066411;C0030231;C0011135;C0042672;C3245491;C0001617;C0032976;C0232970;C0700589;C0192573;C0035078;C0009806;C0009806;C0009806;C0013216;C0944911;C0013227;C0278329;C0013227;C0543467;C0442034;C0027360;C0032952;C0087111;C0030049;C0087111;C4551656;C0011900;C0005632;C3489575;C0282090;C0087111;C0199230;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0015846;C0086960;C0282090;C0282090;C0032483;C0205160;C0237607;C0282090;C0150312;C0150312;C0085590;C0011946;C0011946;C0549206;C0013404;C0040808;C0262512;C0040808;C0040808;C0021359;C0012634;C0262926;C0020517;C0028678;C0242402;C0242402;C0242402;C0242402;C0242402;C0242402;C0242402;C0025663;C0029473;C0042036;C0014268;C0015733;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0030193;C1561540;C1114365;C1561538;C0086960;C1283557;C0009797;C4082977;C4082977;C4684637;C4684637;C4684637;C4684637;C3842337;C4684637;C3842337;C4684637;C0599655;C1320102;C3809765;C3843422;C3714738;C0010124;C3272565;C3272565;C1172713;C4084912;C0332534;C3843399;C1706074;C1706074;C1553756;C1521740;C0231530;C3245501,C0066411;C0009806,20170901,,,Terminated,30922276;25165428,1,0.5,0.013775990945049001,0.013365456331377,"Age ΓëÍ 18 years;;;;;;;;;;Receiving palliative care;;;;;;;;;;Life expectancy ΓëÍ 2 weeks;;;;;;;;;;Able to give informed consent;;;;;;;;;;Receiving opioid treatment with either morphine sulphate, oxycodone or fentanyl;;;;;;;;;;Opioid treatment, both;;;;;;;;;;On a regular schedule (not just as needed or rescue doses) for the control of                  pain or dyspnea for at least 2 weeks before the first dose of methylnaltrexone,                  and;;;;;;;;;;On a stable opioid regimen for at least 3 days before the first dose of                  methylnaltrexone.

Purpose To compare MiraLAX versus placebo for preventing constipation in the immediate      postoperative period following pelvic reconstructive surgery in women taking routine docusate      sodium.      B. Objectives        1. Specific Aims Specific Aim 1: To compare time to first bowel movement (BM) between           MiraLAX versus placebo in women receiving routine docusate sodium after pelvic           reconstructive surgery.           Specific Aim 2: To compare patient reported outcomes of BM quality and associated           gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms between MiraLAX versus placebo using the Bristol stool           scale and the validated Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptom Questionnaire           (PAC-SYM) in women receiving routine docusate sodium after pelvic reconstructive           surgery.           Specific Aim 3: To evaluate GI-related quality of life between MiraLAX versus placebo           utilizing the validated Patient Assessment of Constipation Quality-of-Life Questionnaire           (PAC-QOL) in women receiving routine docusate sodium after pelvic reconstructive           surgery.        2. Hypotheses The investigators hypothesize that MiraLAX will optimally prevent           constipation following pelvic reconstructive surgery by decreasing time to first BM,           decreasing GI symptoms associated with constipation, and increasing measures of           GI-related quality of life, while minimizing the bothersome side effects associated with           stimulant laxatives.",Postoperative constipation;Urogynecologic Surgery;MiraLax;Docusate Sodium;,"Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;",C0009806;C0032042;C0543467;C0012082,C1096777;C0243237;C0009806;C0032042;C0543467;C1547582;C0456909;C0012082,C0524865;C0524865;C0524865;C0304553;C0747307;C0243237;C0243237;C0518214;C0518214;C0243237;C0518214;C0011135;C0034394;C0034394;C0009806;C0009806;C0009806;C0009806;C0009806;C0877248;C0031809;C0031809;C0442797;C0442797;C1697779;C1692318;C0032042;C0032042;C0032042;C1550655;C1457887;C0543467;C0032042;C1550655;C0543467;C0025344;C0030797;C0030797;C0030797;C0030797;C0030797;C0015733;C0175659;C2948600;C2948600;C2948600;C0018017;C2707256;C1457887;C1457887;C0233492;C0233492;C0221106;C0524865;C0524865;C1552740;C1552740;C1552740;C1552740;C0220825,C0009806,C0042025;C0430064;C0020517;C0843083;C0022658;C0232973;C0230273;C0013227;C0282090;C0015252;C0184661;C0032074;C0033377;C0543467;C0020517;C0018787;C0543467;C0566415;C0043240;C0947630;C0021853;C0376660;C1446468;C0181805;C0003461;C1561538;C0543467;C1293097;C4283785;C0728774,C0337443,20150401,,,Completed,27500338,0,0.0,0.01044410154101,0.011358108486068998,English-speaking female patients;;;;;;;;;;> 18 years of age;;;;;;;;;;Not pregnant (patients of childbearing potential will have a serum pregnancy test done             pre-operatively as part of their surgical planning);;;;;;;;;;Undergoing surgery for pelvic organ prolapse or stress urinary incontinence;;;;;;;;;;Recruited from the Duke University Division of Urogynecology,Allergy/hypersensitivity to study medications;;;;;;;;;;Cardiac or renal disease;;;;;;;;;;Takes chronic daily laxatives;;;;;;;;;;Excluded if unable to complete at least 5 days of a 7 day baseline bowel diary;;;;;;;;;;Excluded if mesh resection or Interstim procedure;;;;;;;;;;Excluded if concurrent surgery includes anal sphincteroplasty or rectovaginal fistula             repair,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
