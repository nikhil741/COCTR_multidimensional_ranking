Nasal continuous positive airway pressure      (CPAP) is the treatment of choice for this condition because it is highly effective in      reducing the frequency of nocturnal respiratory events, improving sleep architecture,      decreasing daytime sleepiness and improving blood pressure. Incomplete patient adherence,      however, limits the effectiveness of CPAP therapy and results in sub-optimal patient      outcomes. Previous efforts to enhance CPAP adherence have resulted in only modest      improvements, have generally not been theory-driven, and have had minimal effects on key      patient outcomes such as reduction in OSA symptoms or increase in health-related quality of      life (HRQOL). The planned intervention in this proposal, the Sleep Apnea Self-Management      Program (SASMP), is based on the rationale that sleep apnea is a chronic disease that      requires significant self-care on the part of the patient. We draw on the extensive chronic      disease self-management literature to provide a solid theoretical justification for this      pragmatic intervention both to better manage key aspects of OSA and to increase CPAP      adherence. Chronic disease management programs help reduce symptoms, improve HRQOL, improve      treatment adherence, and decrease medical utilization.",Continuous positive airway pressure;Patient compliance;Self-care;,"Nervous System Diseases;Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;Respiratory Tract Diseases;",C0086969;C0037315,C0086969;C0037315,C0199451;C1303150;C0520679;C0541854;C0086969;C0008679;C0086969;C0851578;C0005823;C1306597;C0009566;C4553491;C0184661;C0184661;C0037315;C0037315;C0442797;C0023866;C0087111;C0012634;C4551656;C3872897;C0087111;C0039082;C1948033;C0087111;C0376691;C0012634;C1547296;C3245511;C0028429;C0037313;C1552861;C0042497;C0442797;C1457887;C1457887;C1555587;C0184511;C0184511;C0015264;C1518681;C0233492;C0040399;C2347273;C0013126;C3245501;C4698437;C4698129;C4698129;C4698129;C4698129,C0039082;C0003578,C0520679;C1301624;C0184633;C0009488;C0011900;C3272565;C1705232;C1548341;C0026987;C2707931,C1446409;C0178987,20091201,0.0,480.0,Completed,29065955,0,0.0,0.017194355834691002,0.015108468101082,Clinical diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea;;;;;;;;;;No previous use of CPAP;;;;;;;;;;Must be a Veteran with residence within San Diego County,"Home oxygen therapy;;;;;;;;;;Fatal comorbidities (i.e., life expectancy less than 6 mos);;;;;;;;;;Contraindications for CPAP use",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

People with OSA often have an      increased risk for developing heart disease or may already have a diagnosis of heart disease.      A clinical research study is being conducted at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) and Beth      Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) to compare the effects of continuous positive airway      pressure (CPAP) to conservative medical therapy with participation in one of four groups:        1. Active-PAP Therapy Group (Active-Beh or Active+Beh): Will receive standard medical           treatment for sleep apnea with active-PAP. Participants will be randomized to either:             1. Active-Pap with respiratory therapist visits only             2. Active-Pap with respiratory therapist visits and cognitive behavioral therapist                visits.        2. Alternative PAP Group (Sham): Will receive lower air delivery level than active-PAP           therapy group. Will also have meetings with respiratory therapist.        3. Conservative Medical Therapy Group (CMT)*: Will receive a free supply of nasal strips           for the duration of their treatment period (either 6 months or 12 months) and follow           healthy sleep hygiene guidelines for how to change sleep habits to minimize incidences           of apneas (breathing disturbances during sleep). Frequent follow-up support with           research coordinator.      A sleep doctor or cardiologist will have indicated that a potential participant is an      appropriate candidate to receive PAP or CMT as acceptable approaches to treat his/her sleep      apnea. Participants will be recruited between the ages of 45-75 years who have diagnosed      heart disease or between 55-75 years for those who have risk factors for developing heart      disease.      This is a 6-12 month study** to evaluate alternative ways to address the potential for OSA      treatment to reduce heart disease and to identify those features that would strengthen a      later, large-scale randomized controlled trial.

The primary objective of this study is to determine whether CPAP adherence in stroke patients      with obstructive sleep apnea can be improved by a CPAP training strategy during      rehabilitation combined with a telemedicine monitoring system after discharge.      The secondary objective is to compare recording quality as well as subjective and objective      sleep data of non-attended level III polygraphy, polysomnography and telemetric CPAP data in      the management of sleep apnea in stroke.      Further the investigators aim to study changes in nocturnal systolic blood pressure due to      CPAP therapy with the pulse transit time method.      Finally, the investigators intend to study the relationship between CPAP compliance, sleep      and medical and neurorehabilition outcome parameters.      Design:      Single-blind, mono-center, randomized controlled trial on standard CPAP treatment as compared      with CPAP treatment with a telemedicine monitoring system in stroke patients with moderate to      severe OSA.      Setting: Neurorehabilitation center in Vienna, Austria      Patients: Adult subacute (1 to 12 months post stroke) stroke patients 18-70 yrs of age) with      moderate to severe OSA (apnea hypopnea index (AHI) ≥ 15/hr) determined by non-attended      polysomnography (AHI) ≥ 15/hr of sleep) or level III polygraphy (AHI) ≥ 30/hr of      out-of-center sleep testing (OCST), who undergo successful CPAP training and titration (goal      AHI< 10) at the neurorehabilitation unit.      Interventions: Patients will be randomized to either standard care with an autotitrating CPAP      device or an autotitrating CPAP device that transmits physiologic information (i.e.,      adherence, air leak, residual AHI) daily to a website that will be reviewed by their homecare      provider. If any problems are identified, the patient will be contacted by his homecare      provider by telephone. Neurologists performing sleep and neurological scoring will be blinded      to the randomization.      Measurements: Recording of the different measuring systems, subjective and objective sleep      quality, CPAP adherence after 3 months and 1 year in hours used per night, systolic BP      determined by means of a non-linear algorithm and an individual one-point calibration of the      pulse transit time obtained with a cuff-based BP measuring system (SOMNOmedics GmbH, Germany)      and neurorehabilitation outcome parameters as Barthel Index, Timed Up and Go Test.",obstructive sleep apnea;CPAP;stroke;telemedicine;neurorehabilitation;systolic blood pressure;,"Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;Nervous System Diseases;Cardiovascular Diseases;Respiratory Tract Diseases;",C0162648;C0037315;C0150369;C0038454,C0162648;C0037315;C0150369;C0011900;C0087111;C0038454;C0392347;C1548341,C0282440;C0520679;C0871470;C0204096;C1139730;C1139730;C0162701;C0162701;C0034991;C0162701;C1273869;C0451019;C0162648;C0162648;C0037315;C0037315;C0597266;C0376636;C0597266;C0018017;C0012621;C0027627;C0018017;C0018017;C0087111;C0087111;C0162621;C0018017;C0002045;C0184511;C0679199;C2828392;C0235546;C2828392;C0282443;C1555587;C1555587;C0087111;C0087111;C4281677;C2349146;C0684224;C0205082;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0025663;C1549113;C0038454;C0205082;C0038454;C0038454;C0205082;C0947630;C0947630;C0037313;C0947630;C0034107;C0947630;C0037313;C0456909;C0003578;C0918012;C0037313;C0037313;C0037313;C0034107;C3245479;C3245479;C0018017;C1561543;C1273517;C0022885;C0204096;C0204096;C0018017;C4699604;C0442694;C0442694;C1550655;C1550655;C0033213;C3842480;C2707261;C3242430;C4082977;C4082977;C2979880;C3714738;C1550043;C2979880;C3843236;C1515258;C1561542;C0729829;C3245509;C1547226;C1547226;C1547226;C1995642;C0031843;C4698129;C4082977;C4698129;C4698129;C4698129,C0039082;C0003578,C0024117;C0520680;C0541854;C0022658;C0424574;C0037315;C0031809;C0037315;C0027404;C0011900;C0011900;C0012634;C0011265;C0700287;C0442711;C0087111;C0087111;C0038454;C0006826;C0205082;C0566415;C0725694;C0009421;C0018026;C1551994;C4699604;C1550655;C1550655;C1548428;C2328206;C0600109,C0005823;C0037313,20180801,,,Completed,30176970;29317418,2,1.0,0.01254569485597,0.0173283216574,Adults (18-70 yrs of age) with a subacute stroke (1-12 months);;;;;;;;;;Diagnosis of sleep apnea and acceptance of CPAP therapy:,"Patients with sopor/coma;;;;;;;;;;Any form of dementia (Mini-Mental State Examination <20);;;;;;;;;;Previously diagnosed sleep apnea and established CPAP therapy;;;;;;;;;;Purely central sleep apnea;;;;;;;;;;Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease more than Gold III;;;;;;;;;;Cancer;;;;;;;;;;Severe kidney diseases;;;;;;;;;;Coexisting causes of daytime sleepiness (e.g. narcolepsy, night or rotating             shift-work; self-reported average sleep duration <4 h);;;;;;;;;;A major psychiatric or any other acute medical condition;;;;;;;;;;Patients unable or unwilling to comply with the protocol",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Epidemiological studies in our country have shown that OSA is a highly prevalent disease in      the general population, affecting 2-4% of the adult population. The most important clinical      manifestations of OSAS is a deterioration in the quality of life and an increase in      cardiovascular disease. OSA is also associated with traffic accidents. Therefore, and      considering the medical complications of OSA, as well as the sociolaboral impact and its      negative impact on quality of life and survival; is stated that this disease is a public      health problem that requires the physician to identify patients eligible to treatment.      Moreover, it has been shown that undiagnosed patients, duplicate the consumption of health      resources, comparing when the diagnosis and treatment has been established. Finally, we have      a highly effective treatment using positive pressure in the upper airway (CPAP) that has been      shown to be effective and cost-effective. The current situation in which all patients      diagnosed with OSA and receiving different treatments are monitored and controlled by the      Sleep Units (SU) is an oversized medicine specialist at the expense of primary care (PC). Our      working hypothesis is: ""By the coordination of actions at various levels including      interactive training equipment AP, use the bilateral (SU-AP) of electronic medical records      and the use of new technologies can be achieved in AP satisfactory management of the      diagnostic and therapeutic process of patients with suspected OSA. Patients assisted in both      areas have a level of clinical response, satisfaction, compliance and avoidance of      complications, similar to that obtained with monitoring by SU.

Their      control could reduce the burden of heart disease across populations. There are several drugs      to control hypertension, but the only consistently beneficial treatment to reduce apneas is      continuous positive airway pressure. The demonstration that one drug could improve sleep      apnea and hypertension would support a novel approach in the treatment of both diseases. The      role of fluid retention in sleep apnea is known for several decades. The role of diuretics is      well established in hypertension but was never appropriately tested in sleep apnea.

This can frequently result in daytime impairments      including difficulties with memory. The state-of-the-art treatment for SDB is Continuous      Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP). Many non-demented SDB patients who are successfully treated      with CPAP show improvement in memory and other cognitive functions. Data have shown that      patients with Parkinson's disease have a high rate of SDB. Patients with Parkinson's disease      also often have problems with memory. This study will test the effects of treating SDB among      patients with Parkinson's disease and SDB. Specifically, the study will test the effect of      CPAP treatment on SDB and sleep; the effect of CPAP treatment on daytime sleepiness,      cognition, overall quality of life and mood; the effect of CPAP treatment on the frequency of      symptoms of REM behavior disorder and restless legs syndrome; the effect of continued CPAP      use (beyond the six weeks of the study) on SDB, sleep, cognition, mood and quality of life;      whether the study-partner feels that CPAP improves the patient's sleep, mood and overall      functioning; whether study-partners feel that their own sleep, mood and overall functioning      improve as the patient's sleep improves both during the 6-week protocol and at follow-up for      those opting to continue using CPAP.",sleep;dementia;apnea;memory;Parkinson's disease;,Nervous System Diseases;Respiratory Tract Diseases;,C0030567;C0037315,C0037315;C0497327,C4551689;C0035258;C0392335;C0030567;C0030567;C0030567;C0541854;C0004930;C0518083;C0518214;C0518214;C0425946;C1299586;C0037315;C0237607;C0004048;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0009240;C0087111;C0009240;C1446409;C0460139;C0860630;C0442711;C0030054;C0006104;C0025260;C0458827;C0025260;C0025260;C1518681;C1518681;C1518681;C1518681;C0947630;C0947630;C0037313;C0947630;C0037313;C0947630;C1527305;C0037313;C0947630;C0037313;C0037313;C0392366;C0392366;C0026516;C0026516;C0026516;C1527305;C0026516;C0684336;C1550655;C1550655;C0033213;C1457887;C0184511;C1518681;C3844714;C2347273;C0184511;C0184511;C0332155;C1444662,C0039082;C0003578;C0030567,C0024117;C0599833;C0007787;C0020440;C0027051;C0740858;C4083070;C0030567;C0520680;C0525041;C0020592;C0004936;C0042373;C0014544;C0006280;C0034108;C0878544;C0013227;C0013227;C0037315;C0037315;C0013227;C0003811;C0220825;C0011900;C0011900;C0235546;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0009240;C0027415;C0700292;C0011900;C0087111;C3272565;C0011265;C0038317;C0018787;C0006104;C0392148;C0012634;C0011265;C0441792;C0262512;C0262512;C0262512;C0033213;C0003578;C1547311;C0025260;C1518681;C0442696;C0030054;C0002962;C0038454;C0037313;C0947630;C0699809;C0037313;C0947630;C0805701;C1561543;C3540798;C0202155;C0231221;C0201829;C1550655;C0282151;C0033978;C1320102;C1546417;C2986890;C0332534;C0332534;C1706074;C1561542;C1706074;C3534109;C4331837;C0231221;C0031809;C1947943,C0012634,20130501,0.0,114.0,Completed,27448468,8,8.0,0.017194355834691002,0.015539882022408,"Clinical diagnosis of dementia due to Parkinson's disease (according to the fourth             edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (code 294.1);;;;;;;;;;MMSE score between 18 and 26, inclusive; cognitive symptoms must occur at least one             year after the diagnosis of PDD;;;;;;;;;;Apnea hypopnea index >10 (i.e., 10 apneas plus hypopneas per hour of sleep);;;;;;;;;;Over the age of 50 years;;;;;;;;;;Stable health;;;;;;;;;;Fluent English speaking;;;;;;;;;;Patients will be allowed to continue dopaminergic medications, acetylcholinesterase             inhibitors, psychotropic medications, memory enhancers, health food supplements, etc.             as long as they have been stable on the same dose for at least two months prior to             participation and agree to continue on this dose for the duration of the 6-week study.","Current treatment for sleep apnea (to avoid discontinuing already established             treatment for sleep apnea and any carry over confounding effect of treatment on             cognition).;;;;;;;;;;Central sleep apnea;;;;;;;;;;Use of medications known to influence sleep (i.e. sedative hypnotics, narcotics) if             the dose cannot remain stable for the duration of the study.;;;;;;;;;;Bronchospastic and symptomatic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as indicated by             regular use of bronchodilators, steroids, history of carbon dioxide retention, waking             hypoxemia (PaO2 <60 mmHg or SpO2 <92 % by pulse oximetry), or use of supplemental             oxygen.;;;;;;;;;;Symptomatic coronary or cerebral vascular disease (history of myocardial infarction,             angina, stroke, or transient ischemic attacks), history of life-threatening             arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, or current alcohol or drug abuse;;;;;;;;;;Current diagnosis of active seizure disorder; presence of any neurodegenerative             disorder other than PDD or other causes of dementia;;;;;;;;;;Any behavioral or physical problem that would preclude completion of the primary             evaluation or treatment with CPAP.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Poor adherence to the primary treatment of OSA -- continuous positive airway      pressure (CPAP) therapy - is associated with increased risk for heart attacks, strokes and      even death. The investigators plan to improve CPAP adherence in veterans through their      interactions with peers who have successfully adopted CPAP therapy.      Such ""peer-buddies"" may promote the well-being of veterans while remaining highly      cost-effective when compared to healthcare providers. Our strategy is grounded on the      rationale that veterans as a group are ecoculturally more homogenous than expected for the      given level of differences in age, gender, ethnicity, or socioeconomic strata. Our long-term      objectives are to initiate a larger, multi-site, research study for enhancing CPAP adherence      in veterans with OSA.

Changes in SDB will be compared between subjects randomized to weight loss (Lifestyle      Intervention Group) versus non-weight loss (Diabetes Education and Support Group) conditions      within the context of the Look AHEAD Study. Weight loss is frequently recommended for obese      patients with OSA, but the empirical foundation for this recommendation is not well      substantiated. Weight loss in obese apneics improves but does not eliminate SDB. Moreover,      the degree of improvement is not correlated with the amount of weight loss. This study will      assess SDB before treatment and at 1 and 2 years. We will also investigate clinical measures      of fat distribution that may mediate the non-linear relationship between weight loss and      improvements in SDB.

The admission rate      for patients with heart failure is on the rise, so is the mortality associated with it and      its national annual bill, now exceeding $21 billion (1). Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is      present in 11-37 percent of patients with heart failure (2,3), and tends to increase in      severity when the heart failure is less controlled (4, 5). Therefore, the actual prevalence      of OSA in patients hospitalized with acute heart failure is likely higher. There is now      evidence that treatment of OSA with nasal Continuous Positive Pressure (nCPAP) in outpatients      with stable heart failure improves left ventricular ejection fraction, and quality of life      (6), and confers a reduction in fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events (7). However, there      has not been any evaluation of the role of diagnosis and treatment of OSA in patients      hospitalized with acute heart failure. This uncertainty about the true prevalence and role of      OSA in exacerbations of heart failure, and the role of its treatment in the acute setting may      explain why aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic strategy for OSA in patients admitted to      the hospital with acute heart failure is not part of the standard clinical practice in acute      care centers. Given the rising admission rate, and mortality associated with heart failure,      an evaluation of the role of OSA and its treatment in this patient population is highly      significant.","Sleep apnea,;obstructive sleep apnea,;heart failure,;CHF;","Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;Nervous System Diseases;Cardiovascular Diseases;Respiratory Tract Diseases;",C0018801;C4086268;C0037315;C0011900;C0087111;C1547229,C0018801;C4086268;C0037315;C0011900;C0087111;C1547229;C3871154,C0042508;C0018802;C0520679;C1320716;C0264714;C0264714;C0264714;C0518214;C0018801;C0018801;C0018801;C0018801;C0018801;C0018801;C0701159;C0701159;C0087130;C0220825;C0220825;C0184666;C0087111;C4551656;C0011900;C0087111;C0087111;C0184666;C0087111;C1446409;C0460139;C0679199;C0184666;C2828392;C0237607;C0150312;C0542559;C0332148;C0028429;C1704326;C1704326;C1704326;C1704326;C0087111;C0001721;C4318616;C2911690;C1547300;C0011900;C4086268;C1706074;C1328018;C3854058;C0184511;C3272565,C0039082;C0018787;C0003578,C0264490;C0018801;C2707261;C1446409;C0011946;C0948268;C1555587;C0009797,C0037313;C0037313,20080801,0.0,108.0,Completed,19567491,12,12.0,0.013002438665045,0.012901071953894,Able to provide an informed consent;;;;;;;;;;Speaks English;;;;;;;;;;Older than 21;;;;;;;;;;Heart Failure;;;;;;;;;;Positive for OSA,CSA;;;;;;;;;;Already on CPAP;;;;;;;;;;Hemodynamic instability;;;;;;;;;;Acute respiratory failure;;;;;;;;;;Neurological defect;;;;;;;;;;Dialysis,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Patients with      AIS with proximal arterial obstruction and clinically suspected sleep apnea will be      randomized to standard or standard stroke care plus auto-BPAP. Auto-BPAP will be initiated      within 24 hours from stroke onset and performed for a maximum of 48 hours during diurnal and      nocturnal sleep. Patients will undergo cardiorespiratory polygraphy between day 3 and 5 to      assess sleep apnea. The primary endpoint is any early neurological improvement on the NIHSS      at 72 hours from randomization. Safety, tolerability, short-term and 3 months functional      outcomes are assessed as secondary endpoints by un-blinded and blinded observers      respectively. This study will provide data to power a subsequent phase III study.","Ischemic stroke, sleep apnea, non-invasive ventilatory treatment;",Nervous System Diseases;Cardiovascular Diseases;Respiratory Tract Diseases;,C2707261;C0751956;C0037315;C1441488;C1710083,C2707261;C0751956;C0037315;C0947630;C1441488;C1434505;C1710083;C3897779,C0264995;C2986535;C0948008;C0428719;C0037315;C0035203;C0035203;C0035203;C0037315;C0037315;C0597266;C0027627;C0205160;C1446409;C2828392;C2828392;C0947630;C0947630;C0038454;C0038454;C0947630;C0037313;C0947630;C0947630;C3245479;C1441488;C3245479;C1561538;C4554468;C1550655;C1550655;C1555587;C2707261;C0001721;C0743195;C2911690;C3844714;C1446409;C0031843;C1561542;C1552839;C0018792;C1334278;C1334278;C1334278;C3272565;C4554418;C4489236,C0039082;C0003578,C0600260;C0007276;C0007276;C0149566;C0521654;C0521654;C0040405;C0007770;C0442867;C0019993;C0006147;C1096775;C0034394;C0009488;C0018801;C0524466;C0002978;C0002978;C0037315;C0037315;C0037315;C0037315;C0041618;C0013144;C0021308;C0021925;C0242114;C0028778;C0028778;C0011900;C0231881;C0030971;C0030971;C0087111;C0087111;C3272565;C1261287;C2828392;C0011265;C0549206;C2828392;C0034975;C1457887;C0262512;C0038454;C1552826;C0205082;C0205082;C0205082;C0205082;C0175659;C0003578;C0037313;C0175659;C4321237;C0243032;C3854213;C1301624;C0087153;C0087153;C0009797;C1328956;C0699794;C1320102;C0751438;C1697779;C3534109;C1553756;C0751437;C1334278;C1334278;C0032927,C0948008;C0037315;C0087111;C0087153;C1334278,20151201,,,Unknown status,23941576,1,1.0,0.01166197196982,0.012648830460875,"Male and female patients 18 - 80 years;;;;;;;;;;;Clinical suspicion of an AIS (measurable or fluctuating neurological deficit with a             National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] ΓëÍ 4 points) within 24 hours from             symptom-onset;;;;;;;;;;;Extracranial (internal carotid artery) or intracranial (internal carotid artery;             middle/anterior/posterior cerebral arteries) ΓëÍ 50% stenosis, near-occlusion or             occlusion diagnosed by ultrasound, computed tomography angiography (CTA) or magnetic             resonance angiography (MRA), corresponding to acute neurological deficit;;;;;;;;;;;High-risk of having sleep apnea (classified by the Berlin sleep apnea questionnaire);             or history of known sleep apnea; or witnessed repetitive apnea episodes during sleep             or somnolence during hospitalization;;;;;;;;;;;Written informed consent by participants; alternatively by proxy or two physicians             when not obtainable by patient or proxy (according to local regulations).","Perceived course towards the malignant middle cerebral artery infarction;;;;;;;;;;;Immediate or perceived need for intubation;;;;;;;;;;;Known sleep apnea currently on non-invasive ventilatory treatment;;;;;;;;;;;Standard contraindications for non-invasive ventilatory treatment;;;;;;;;;;;Pre-morbid modified Rankin scale (mRS) score ΓëÍ 3;;;;;;;;;;;Severe comorbidities (i.e., severe heart failure, severe obstructive lung disease,             active malignant disease, severe dementia);;;;;;;;;;;Pregnant and breast feeding women;;;;;;;;;;;Participation in another clinical trial other than standard-of-care registry.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Its onset is      usually at the time of puberty with manifestations of menstrual irregularity, hirsutism, and      obesity. Women with PCOS suffer at an early stage of adulthood from all of the components of      the metabolic syndrome, a syndrome that typically has its peak in mid-life in other subject      populations. Women with PCOS are more insulin resistant than weight-matched control women and      have exceptionally high rates of early-onset impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes,      as well as a substantially elevated risk for hypertension, dyslipidemia, coronary, and other      vascular diseases. While recent evidence indicates that the prevalence of sleep-disordered      breathing (SDB) is 30-40 fold higher in PCOS than in weight-matched control women, the      possible role of SDB in causing the increased metabolic and cardiovascular risks of PCOS has      not been evaluated. The overall objective of the proposed study is to analyze the direction      of causality between sleep disturbances and markers of the metabolic syndrome in PCOS.",polycystic ovary syndrome;metabolic syndrome;obstructive sleep apnea;impaired glucose tolerance;insulin resistance;,"Neoplasms;Nervous System Diseases;Respiratory Tract Diseases;Endocrine System Diseases;Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications;Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;",C0032460;C0037315,C0032460;C3887460;C0277785;C2707259;C0037313,C0271650;C0032460;C0156404;C0524620;C0037317;C0524620;C0042373;C0011860;C3887460;C0020538;C0242339;C0019572;C0004048;C0018017;C0039082;C0018787;C0332149;C0034011;C0028754;C0021641;C0683278;C1305866;C1305866;C1300072;C0037313;C0947630;C4086718;C1704326;C1833334;C0001721;C0005516;C0012634;C1514892;C2707259;C0220825;C0856882;C0729829;C0029166;C0151576,C0039082;C0003578;C0003578;C0029928,C0001627;C0852654;C0424621;C0040405;C0009905;C0428412;C0010481;C0206081;C0025329;C1277972;C0020676;C0021359;C0013227;C0013227;C0002453;C0277786;C0011900;C0019572;C0000726;C0036537;C0025274;C0392148;C0002170;C0332149;C0012634;C0262512;C0947630;C0038317;C0021641;C0032105;C0087136;C0424589;C0231683;C1553386;C0045143;C0918012;C1306645;C0037313;C0947630;C0037313;C0001144;C0577559;C0441633;C0441633;C0000925;C1299574;C0439775;C4699619;C4699619;C4699613;C3245501;C4684637;C1328956;C1571705;C0071888;C1553821;C4699604;C0441229;C0596948;C1564718,C0032460;C0017725;C0037313;C0237834,20080601,2.0,153.0,Terminated,18647805,12,12.0,0.017194355834691002,0.012116854244065,"PCOS subjects will be recruited from the Endocrinology Clinics of the University of             Chicago.

The aspiration of secretions of the upper airway and the      colonization by microorganisms is considered a main event in most of the cases of community      acquired pneumonia (CAP) , and specially in the nosocomial pneumonia. The silent aspiration      to the lower airway is a common phenomenon in normal subjects during the sleep and some      studies has reported that the patients with SAHS present an increase of the risk to      pharyngeal aspirations. In fact, the presence of nasal and bronchial inflammation in patients      with SAHS is a recognized event. The patients with SAHS could have a risk increased to      develop pneumonia due to predisposition to the pharyngeal microaspiration to lower airways      during the sleep and other mechanical factors associated. The prevalence of SAHS in patients      with CAP could be increased as regards the data published for the same Spanish population.      The presence of an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) could be a risk factor not only to to CAP but      to to present a unfavorable clinical evolution in comparison to patients with CAP with a      normal AHI.
