We will randomize youth to one of two arms (goal 30 per arm completing 3-month follow-up): 1) MOMENT (MET + momentary self-monitoring + context-dependent feedback), or 2) MET-only. The two study arms will permit evaluation of the contributions of the self-monitoring and feedback components of the intervention above-and-beyond the MET and directly test the influence of the intervention on the link between momentary context and marijuana-related outcomes. The specific aims of the study are Specific Aim 1: Continued Feasibility Evaluation. In our preliminary work, we demonstrated that 1) youth perceive MOMENT to be easy to understand, comfortable, motivating, and helpful in reducing their marijuana use, 2) we can recruit 4 participants/month (minimum rate for the proposed study), and 3) we can successfully implement a MOMENT intervention study in the proposed recruitment sites. Based on this work, we have identified additional areas of feasibility on which to focus in the proposed study. Specifically, we aim to achieve: 1a. A signal response rate of at least 70% during each of three periods of momentary data collection - baseline, intervention, and 3-month follow-up. 1b. A diary response rate of at least 70% during each momentary data collection period 1. c. A retention rate of at least 80% of participants at the 3-month follow-up. Specific Aim 2. Early-Stage Efficacy Exploration. Our preliminary work showed that both momentary and individual-level outcomes improved from baseline to three months post-intervention. The primary momentary outcomes are desire to use marijuana when in a triggering context and likelihood of use following exposure to a triggering context. The primary individual-level outcomes are number of use events/week, 30-day percent of days abstinent, dose/use event, and measures of motivation (importance of, readiness for, and confidence about reducing use). Based on the preliminary findings, we will explore these early-stage efficacy questions: 2. a. Will improvements in momentary outcomes be observed with MOMENT, but not MET-only? (1) The association between exposure to self-identified trigger contexts and momentary desire to use marijuana will be attenuated at three months, compared to pre-intervention. (2) The likelihood of marijuana use following exposure to a trigger context will be reduced at three months. 2b. Will improvements in individual-level outcomes be greater with MOMENT vs. MET-only? 1. The reduction in marijuana use frequency (events/week and 30-day percent of days abstinent) and dose (per use event) will be greater at three months. 2. The increase in motivation to reduce or discontinue use will be greater at three months.',\n",

This study includes 3 stages. The stage 1 will be an 8-week double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled treatment period. Following completion of Stage 1 and after completing the data clean for the initial 6 weeks, the investigator will be un-blinded to treatment assignment on an individual subject basis to enable appropriate starting dose selection for stage 2, a 24-week open-label treatment period. PK sampling and assessments will occur at the Week 2 visit during stage 2 of the study, when all subjects are receiving eltrombopag. After the completion of stage 2, subjects may continue the eltrombopag treatment in stage 3, if he/she can benefit from the continuous eltrombopag treatment based on investigator's judgement. The initial dose of eltrombopag administration is 25 mg orally once daily. During the 8 weeks double-blind treatment, dose of investigational product will be adjusted according to the weekly subject platelet count. The eligible subjects who have completed stage 1 (8 weeks of double-blind treatment period: the first 6 weeks data will be used for primary endpoint analysis and the last 2 weeks will be data clean period during which period the blinded treatment is continued as to the first 6 weeks) would enter a voluntary open-label stage 2 (24-week open-label extension phase) in which subjects from both eltrombopag group and placebo group will have the opportunity to receive eltrombopag treatment. Subjects unwilling or unqualified (such as the subjects who meet the stopping criteria) to participate in extension treatment will attend follow-up visits for 4 weeks after the completion of double-blind phase. During open-label stage 2 during which period all eligible subjects will receive open label eltrombopag treatment. The dose of eltrombopag will be continuously adjusted according to the subject's platelet count. Following completion of Stage 2, if the subject benefits from the eltrombopag treatment based on investigator's discretion, the subject can voluntarily enter stage 3, during which the subject will continue eltrombopag treatment until the commercial launch of eltrombopag in China.\",\n",

       "  'The goal of this Phase II study is to generate pilot data that will allow for the design of a clinical trial of sildenafil (Viagra®) to treat patients with traumatic vascular injury in the chronic state after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Injury to small and medium-sized blood cerebral blood vessels is a well-recognized consequence of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Non-invasive imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) have long demonstrated deficits in cerebral blood flow in TBI, including in symptomatic patients years after mild TBI (mTBI). Recently, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods have been developed which allow reliable and non-invasive measurement of cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) to vasodilatory stimuli such as hypercapnia in humans. These techniques have never been applied to symptomatic patients in the chronic stage after mTBI. These methods are particularly promising due to the recent discovery that phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitors improve cerebral blood flow, induce angiogenesis and neurogenesis, and improve functional recovery in animals after experimental stroke and cryoinjury. This pilot study will use novel MRI methods (Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) response to hypercapnia) to noninvasively measure cerebrovascular reactivity in the chronic stage after TBI, and the first to use sildenafil in patients with chronic TBI. The study has one primary objective and 10 secondary objectives: Primary objective: 1. Single dose treatment with sildenafil (50 mg orally) is effective in increasing the global BOLD response to hypercapnia in symptomatic patients in the chronic stage after TBI. Secondary objective (Safety and Tolerability): 2. Sildenafil therapy (25 mg orally twice daily) is well tolerated in symptomatic patients in the chronic stage after TBI, with few adverse effects and treatment discontinuations in less than 10% of patients. Tertiary (Exploratory) objectives: 3. Single dose treatment with sildenafil (50 mg orally) is effective in increasing the regional BOLD response to hypercapnia in symptomatic patients in the chronic stage after TBI. 4. Patients with persistent symptoms in the chronic stage after TBI have deficits in cerebrovascular reactivity compared to uninjured healthy controls. 5. Patients with persistent symptoms in the chronic stage after TBI have deficits in cerebrovascular reactivity compared to asymptomatic patients after TBI. 6. Patients with persistent symptoms in the chronic stage after TBI have reduced numbers of circulating EPCs compared to uninjured healthy controls. 7. Patients with persistent symptoms in the chronic stage after TBI have reduced numbers of circulating EPCs compared to asymptomatic patients after TBI. 8. The effect on cerebrovascular reactivity of single dose treatment with sildenafil persists after 8 weeks of chronic therapy (25 mg orally, twice daily). 9. Treatment with sildenafil for 8 weeks (25 mg orally twice daily) increases the number of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in symptomatic chronic TBI patients. 10. Treatment with sildenafil for 8 weeks (25 mg orally twice daily) reduces the prevalence of post-concussive symptoms, compared to placebo treatment. 11. Treatment with sildenafil for 8 weeks (25 mg orally twice daily) improves performance in neuropsychometric tests, compared to placebo treatment.',\n",

       "  'Aim of the investigators\\' study is to evaluate one of the symptoms described by patients affected with the so-called \"not-celiac wheat sensitivity\" (NCWS). NCWS patients may be defined as ones, neither celiac or allergic to wheat, who develop symptoms following wheat consumption and improve on Gluten Free Diet (GFD). Among these, patients often report the appearance of bloating and abdominal pain, and, sometimes, swelling of fingers and face, shortly after ingestion of wheat. They also refer that swelling tends to last for some hours and then to disappear on GFD. To our knowledge, this disorder has never been investigated neither proved. For the investigators\\' research, the investigators selected adult patients, both genders, affected with NCWS. Diagnostic criteria include: 1) symptoms disappearance on GFD, 2) testing negative for celiac disease [anti-tTG and EMA, and with biopsy Marsh 0-1] and wheat allergy [serum specific IgE for wheat], 3) positive response to a double-blind placebo-controlled challenge (DBPC) with wheat or placebo. Patients will be recruited among subjects referring, as outpatients, to the Department of Internal Medicine, \\'Giovanni Paolo II\\' Hospital of Sciacca (Agrigento), and of Internal Medicine of the University of Palermo, from January 2012 to October 2013. The investigators will include patients referring for functional dyspepsia and/or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like symptoms. All recruited patients must report body\\'s swelling immediately after wheat ingestion. In all recruited patients, NCWS diagnosis was posed during the previous years, according to the above mentioned criteria. Patients, all on GFD for at least 30 days, will undergo to another DBPC with wheat or placebo (xylose), performed by administering capsules coded as A or B containing wheat or xylose, respectively. Capsules A or B will be administered once, and then, after 1 week of washout, patients received the other capsules, given once too. Before and 2 hours after every challenge, patients will undergo a complete medical examination (measurement of body weight, height, body mass index [BMI], waist circumference, diameter of thighs, legs, arms, and fingers), and we will perform bioelectrical impedance analysis and collect blood sampling, for identification of possible markers (bioelectrical, immunologic, hormonal, etc) that may help to demonstrate and explain mechanisms of examined symptom.',\n",
       "  'Gluten is the most important protein component of some grains, notably wheat, rye, and barley, which are the basis for a variety of wheat-derived alimentary products consumed throughout the world (bread, pasta, pizza etc). However the \"engineering\" of gluten-containing grains created the conditions for human diseases related to gluten exposure. These forms of gluten intolerance represent a heterogeneous set of conditions, including celiac disease, wheat allergy and gluten sensitivity, that, combined, seems to affect about 10% of the general population. The frequency of not-celiac gluten sensitivity is however still unknown, even though it is possible that this condition have been undiagnosed and under-diagnosed by the physicians for a long time. The immune responsiveness to wheat antigens represents a complex process, and its establishment and maintenance are not completely elucidated. The most frequent diseases caused by wheat ingestion are T cell-mediated disorders, i.e. celiac disease and immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated allergic reactions. However, besides celiac disease and wheat allergy, there are cases of gluten reactions in which neither autoimmune nor IgE-mediated allergic mechanisms are involved. These are generally defined as gluten sensitivity. Some subjects, who experience symptoms when eating gluten-containing products and show improvement when following a gluten-free diet, may have gluten sensitivity instead of celiac disease or wheat allergy. Gluten sensitivity patients are unable to tolerate gluten and develop an adverse reaction when eating gluten, that, usually, and differently from celiac disease, does not lead to small intestinal damage. Gastrointestinal symptoms in gluten sensitivity patients may resemble those associated with celiac disease, but the overall clinical picture is generally less severe and is not accompanied by the occurrence of autoantibodies (i.e. anti-tissue transglutaminase, tTG, or anti-endomysium, EMA) or autoimmune disease (i.e. Hashimoto\\'s thyroiditis). Typically, the diagnosis is made by exclusion, and an elimination diet and an \"open challenge\" (i.e., the monitored reintroduction of gluten-containing foods) are most often used to evaluate whether health improves or worsen with the elimination or reintroduction of gluten in the diet, respectively. As it is not known what cereals components determine the symptoms in the so called gluten sensitivity patients, we prefer to define this condition as \"wheat sensitivity\" instead of \"gluten sensitivity\". Wheat sensitivity can cause both gastrointestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms; among the latter, the patients often reported body\\'s swelling (hands\\', fingers\\', arms\\' , face\\'s swelling). This study has two major aims: 1. Evaluation of the effective dependence from the wheat ingestion of the clinical alterations presented by patients with diagnosed gluten sensitivity, with particular attention to abdominal bloating and body\\'s swelling. The study will be done after a period of gluten-free diet (at least 30 days), using a double-blind placebo-controlled challenge with wheat or placebo (xylose), performed by administering capsules coded as A or B containing wheat or xylose, respectively. Capsules A or B will be administered once, and then, after 1 week of washout, the patients received the other capsules, given once too. 2.

       "  'Body contouring surgery has a higher potential for postoperative pain and wound healing complications. The purpose of this study is to determine if pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) devices can reduce the pain and complications associated with this type of surgery. Pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) devices have been shown to be effective treatments to decrease healing time in nonunion fractures and pressure ulcers, and to reduce pain in whiplash injuries, persistent neck pain, and chronic lower back pain. These devices have been FDA approved for treatment of pain and edema (510(k) number: K070541). More recently, PEMF devices have been shown to decrease postoperative pain and narcotic use in breast augmentation patients. This study seeks to determine if PEMF will also cause similar effects in the more complex procedures performed on body contouring patients. The specific aims of this study are: 1. Evaluate if adjunct PEMF therapy will accelerate the rate of postoperative pain reduction in abdominal body contouring patients. 2. Evaluate if adjunct PEMF therapy will decrease the postoperative use of narcotic pain relievers in abdominal body contouring patients. PEMF devices have been shown to be effective in reduction of pain and pain medication use in breast augmentation patients. No literature has shown if PEMF is an effective adjunct to decrease pain or pain medication use in the abdominal body contouring patient. A decrease in pain would result in a better experience for patients and a reduction in pain medication may decrease complications associated with these medications. The PEMF therapy device being used in this study is a non-significant risk device because it is noninvasive and does not present a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject.',\n",

It is similar to the device that measures the level of oxygen in the tip of the finger, known as a pulse oximeter. The cerebral oximeter consists of a sensor placed on the forehead that both emits and detects the amount of light absorbed. This study will determine how accurate the device is by comparing the displayed value on the monitor with blood samples taken simultaneously from the arterial blood in the wrist and venous blood in the neck. In order to test the device over a suitable range, the level of oxygen within the blood will be reduced in a controlled manner by reduction of the inspired oxygen concentration. This is the equivalent of ascending to an altitude of 16,000 feet. The study will be conducted in healthy volunteers.',\n",
       "  'This is a calibration and validation study of a near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) device designed to measure the cerebral tissue oxygen saturation non-invasively. This is achieved by comparing NIRS-derived cerebral tissue oxygen saturation with a calculated value derived from simultaneous arterial and jugular venous blood samples. At present the FDA have adopted the standards published in 2005 by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), entitled ISO 9919. This is a set of technical specifications and guidelines for pulse oximeters, which share certain technical similarities to cerebral oximeters. In particular, Annex EE details the conduct of a controlled desaturation study for the calibration of pulse oximeter equipment. Specifically, the fraction of inspired oxygen delivered to test subjects is varied to achieve a series of targeted steady state saturation periods over a range of arterial oxygen saturation of 70 - 100%. While cerebral oximeters differ from pulse oximeters in terms of the what is being measured (brain tissue v arterial blood) the FDA have maintained the requirement to examine data from human volunteer studies in which the arterial oxygen saturation ranges from 70 - 100%. Two FDA-approved cerebral oximeters were validated in a similar manner. The device controlling the inspired gas concentration is the RespirAct, which permits precise reduction in the arterial oxygen saturation while maintaining the arterial carbon dioxide level at 40 mmHg.

Using a hormone-withdrawal challenge to precipitate mood symptoms will improve our ability to identify the biological mechanisms underlying both the triggering of and susceptibility to depressive disorders in women; and will permit the prediction of those at risk for PPD and other reproductive-related mood disorders.',\n",
       "  'Affective disorders, such as postpartum depression (PPD) and other reproductive-related mood disorders, are common and constitute a significant burden for women, children, and society. However, little is known about the neurobiological mechanisms underlying depressive disorders in women. The long-term goal of this research is to 1) advance our understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying both the triggering of and susceptibility to depressive disorders in women; and 2) permit the prediction of those at risk for PPD. The objective of the current project is to examine whether those with a past episode of PPD (at \"high risk\" for recurrence) show differences in emotional arousal and reward processing domains relative to healthy control women (without a history of PPD) under baseline and hormone withdrawal-precipitated conditions. The central hypothesis is that reproductive hormone changes are associated with dysregulation of the neural circuits underlying emotional arousal and reward processing and consequent depressive symptoms in high-risk women. The rationale for the proposed study is that employing a scaled down model of puerperal hormonal events in high-risk women permits the identification of a group of individuals homogeneous for reproductive related affective dysfunction and, hence, the best opportunity for disentangling the specific changes in brain function due to reproductive hormones from those accompanying reproductive hormone-precipitated affective dysfunction. Moreover, identifying a neurophysiologic biomarker for hormone-related affective dysfunction provides a clear pathway for examining mechanisms of susceptibility to affective dysfunction across disorders. The investigators plan to accomplish the objectives of this application by pursuing the following specific aims: 1) to assess the effects of simulated postpartum reproductive hormone withdrawal, compared to baseline, on corticolimbic circuit activation in high-risk and control women; and 2) to examine the effects of reproductive hormone withdrawal, compared to baseline, on reward circuit activation in high-risk and control women. An additional exploratory aim is to identify a neural biomarker, characterized by corticolimbic and reward circuit dysfunction, that can be used to predict the onset of PPD. The proposed study involves experimentally manipulating reproductive hormones in euthymic women to create a scaled down version of the changes that occur at the puerperium. This endocrine manipulation paradigm will be used to examine the neurocircuitry underlying the regulation of affect and reward processing under baseline and hormone withdrawal-precipitated conditions among women who are expected to experience hormone-related affective dysregulation (n=15) and controls (n=15). In short, the investigators expect that relative to baseline, high-risk women will show greater dysregulation in neural circuits responsible for emotion processing and reward processing during hormone withdrawal than low-risk control women. The expected outcome of this research is the identification of neural circuits underlying both the susceptibility to and mediation of hormone-related affective dysfunction. Understanding these neurobiological mechanisms will subsequently improve the ability to identify those at risk for PPD, which may strengthen prevention efforts and ultimately prevent the deleterious effects of maternal depression on offspring.',\n",

       "  \"This 5-year project is a randomized controlled trial of the TEA (Together for Empowerment Activities) intervention, a family intervention for HIV-affected families in rural areas of China. The impact of HIV/AIDS is negatively influencing the affected families and their next generation. Currently in China, there are about 740,000 families living with HIV and 105,000 of them have developed AIDS. HIV is radiating through the extended families, shifting the life patterns not only for the parents living with HIV/AIDS (PLH), but also for their children, partners, and other family members. The negative impact of HIV is compounded by Chinese tradition of accepting illness stoically and not discussing difficult issues within the family due to shame and fear. Chronic illness also reverses the Chinese traditional family roles especially when the ill parents are not capable of contributing to housework or providing financial stability and the further burden rests on the children. As a result, the relationship between parents, family members and children is significantly strained. To help PLHs and their family members, the TEA intervention has been developed, refined and piloted in the previous study. The goal of this study is to implement the TEA intervention in a full scale to determine its efficacy and the potential for enhancing HIV policy and programs that support HIV-affected families to cope with the challenges in China in responding to the global HIV epidemic. TEA intervention will have six sessions (plus a preparation session) delivered at three levels simultaneously: 1) TEA Gathering (small group for PLH and their family members), 2) TEA Time (home-based family activities with children that accompany each TEA Gathering), and 3) TEA Garden (community events that build social integration). Built on the successful pilot work by the collaborative team, this intervention trial will include 24 administrative villages with 20 families each, resulting in a total of 480 participating families affected by HIV. The administrative villages will be randomized into two groups (12 villages in each): TEA intervention group and control group (with 240 families in each group). A total of 240 PLH, 240 family members and 360 children at age of 6-18 will be recruited in each group. After the baseline assessment, the TEA intervention will be conducted in the intervention group, but not in the control group. Follow-up assessments will be conducted at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after the intervention is delivered. The impact of the intervention will be assessed by comparing the outcomes measures at baseline and 6-, 12-, 18- and 24-month follow-ups between the intervention and control groups for HIV-affected families, including PLH, family members, and children in poor, rural areas in China (Figure 1). The primary outcomes are children's health, mental health, and behavioral adjustment. The secondary outcomes will be the PLH's and family members' physical health, mental health, and quality of life, as well as family indicators such as family daily routines, positive interactions, parenting, coping, and community integration. The study will be implemented in Anhui, China. Four counties, Lixin, Funan, Yinzhou and Linquan in Anhui Province have been selected as project sites based on the sample size of HIV-affected families and similarity of demographics. Within the selected counties, the administrative villages that have 20 or more HIV-affected families with at least one child aged 6-18 have been identified based on the current epidemiological data, resulting in a total of 24 villages for this study. Through a randomization procedure, 12 villages will be randomized to TEA intervention group and 12 villages to control group. Only the families that have one PLH, at least one family member, and at least one child aged at 6-18 years will be invited to participate. We will recruit all families from each of the villages, resulting in a total of about 480 HIV-affected families with 480 PLHs, 480 family members and 720 children. The purpose of this study is to develop a feasible and practical intervention strategy through a randomized controlled intervention trial, which will help HIV-affected families in rural areas of China to face the challenges of HIV and improve their health and quality of life. The Specific Aims of the study are: 1. To test that the children in the intervention group, compared to those in the control group, will have significantly better physical health, mental health, and behavioral outcomes. 2. To test that the PLH and family members in the intervention group, compared to those in the control group, will have significantly improved physical health, mental health, and quality of life outcomes. 3. To investigate how outcomes of the children, PLH, and family members are mediated by family indicators such as consistent daily routines, positive family interactions, parenting, coping, and community integration.\",\n",

       "  'A Phase IIB/III Multicenter Randomized Trial to Evaluate the Combination of Low-Dose Cyclosporine and Omeprazole Versus Omeprazole Alone in Participants With New Onset Type 1 Diabetes.',\n",
       "  'The purpose of this study is to determine if the combination of oral cyclosporine, an immune therapy and oral omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, are effective in rendering insulin independence among recent onset type 1 diabetes patients. This two-arm study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy for insulin independence of two FDA and EMA-approved therapies among recent onset type 1 diabetes patients. One of the greatest new insights of today in the field of type 1 diabetes, is the understanding that in man, unlike the success seen in type 1 diabetes mouse models, there is no beta cell regeneration with immune therapy alone. In man, type 1 diabetes is now considered to be a disease of both autoimmunity and lack of beta cell regeneration (Levetan 2103). More than 500 patients with new onset type 1 diabetes have been given cyclosporine and some studies have demonstrated as high as a 57% insulin-free remission rate that was not sustained due to the lack of beta cell regeneration (Feutren 1986, Bougneres 1988, Eisenbarth 1989, Sobel 2010). Studies among diabetes patients with proton pump inhibitors have shown the potential to increase beta cell mass by 40%, but among type 1 patients without immune protection, such outcomes cannot be not achieved (Singh 2012, Griffin 2014). The usage of a beta cell regeneration agent such as omeprazole, in combination with an immune tolerance, like cyclosporine, provides both the potential ability to maintain and regenerate beta cells. This is a new paradigm for the treatment of new onset type 1 diabetes. More than 60 human trials have been conducted among type 1 diabetes with a variety of different therapies aimed at preventing autoimmune attack on insulin-producing beta cells. None have been as effective as cyclosporine in both slowing the decline in beta cell mass and resulting in the potential for insulin-free remissions. (Canadian-European Randomized Control Trial 1988, Eisenbarth 1989, Skyler 1992, Sobel 2010). Because cyclosporine is known for its potential side-effects, most notably in the kidney, all previous studies among type 1 patients have carefully monitored kidney function. Follow-up studies for up to 13 years among 285 type 1 patients utilizing cyclosporine for 20 months did not demonstrate renal or other side effects at the dosages that will be used in this trial (Assan 2002). The most effective initiating dosage for insulin independence in the cyclosporine trials was 7.5 mg/kg/day, but for safety, this study will begin at a lower dosage of 5 mg/kg/day and will monitor kidney function and cyclosporine levels initially on a weekly basis. This study will use only those dosages of cyclosporine that have not demonstrated toxicity to the kidney or resulted in non-reversible side effects among more than 500 patients with recent onset type 1 diabetes treated with cyclosporine. Omeprazole has been shown to significantly increase gastrin levels which is associated with increased beta cells. Lansoprazole has also been shown to be safe among patients with new onset type 1 diabetes for one year with a trend toward increased beta cell mass among patients with higher gastrin levels. In a randomized trial for 12 weeks among 56 patients undergoing pancreatectomy, those randomized to receive a proton pump inhibitor had significantly increased gastrin levels, higher insulin levels and improved endocrine function by glucose tolerance testing and less pancreatic atrophy as measured by CT scans (Jang 2003). The recently completed REPAIR T1D trial among newly diagnosed type 1 patients used a proton pump inhibitor and GLP-1 therapies for 1 year for beta regeneration failed to meet its endpoint of increased stimulated C-peptide. Lack of maintenance or regeneration of beta cells was specifically noted to have likely been due to lack of usage of immune therapy to protect beta cells (Griffin 2014, Rigby 2014). Those patients in REPAIR T1D, who did achieve gastrin and GLP-1 levels above those in the control group had a trend towards improved preservation of C-peptide with a suggestion of a decreased rate of fall of C-peptide through 12 months (Griffin 2014 Appendix Supplemental data). Glucose levels also trended lower than controls in the intervention arm with gastrin levels above the control arm (Griffin 2014 Appendix Supplemental data). In humans, the newly forming beta cells are under the greatest immune attack among type 1 patients (Meier 2006). REPAIR T1D underscores the importance for both immune therapy with a regeneration therapy among type 1 patients (Griffin 2014, Rigby 2014). The combination of cyclosporine with a proton pump inhibitor has the potential to demonstrate maintenance and expansion of residual beta cells. This combination therapy provides the unique ability for patients to become insulin independent. For a request of references, please email info@perlebioscience.com',\n",

       "  'The pelvic floor disorders are a major problem in our current society with manifestations of micturition disorders, defecatory problems and sexual dysfunction. The pelvic floor muscles training arouses interest due the few studies on this subject. Studies are being conducted with emphasis on the post-prostatectomy urinary disorders, however, not associated with radiotherapy. The study of the effect of radiotherapy in these muscles is still uncertain. At right, we do not know if the effect of radiation can trigger important anatomical changes that could lead to pelvic floor disorders manifesting clinically as defecatory and urinary disorders. These issues motivate us to research, focusing on the evaluation of these muscles through magnetic nuclear resonance considering that radiation therapy has been increasingly used as a therapeutic option in the treatment of prostate cancer. The primary objective of this is to verify the effect of pelvic floor muscles training (PFMT) tract symptoms (LUTS), anorectal and sexual complaints in men with prostate cancer (PCa) treated with radiotherapy (RT). Secondly, the objective is to evaluate the effect of PFMT in its function and in the severity of urinary incontinence (UI) and evaluate the quality of life. The assessment of the changes occurred by the effect of radiation separately and jointly to the training of the pelvic floor muscles can help us to better understand some of the dysfunctions presented in this sample of patients as well as understanding the effect and the possible contribution of training of these muscles for treatment and/or prevention of these disorders.',\n",
       "  'This present research is a randomized controlled clinical trial to be held in Clinics Hospital of Medical School of Ribeirão Preto - University of São Paulo (HCFMRP-USP) including men with confirmed diagnosis of prostate cancer by biopsy and having clinical indication for radiotherapy treatment (RT) who follow-up in the HCFMRP-USP and voluntarily consent to participate in this research. After consent, each patient must sign the consent term and then will be allocated by randomization in one of the following study groups: - Training group (TG): the group of patients undergoing radiotherapy and submitted to pelvic floor muscles training; - Control group (CG): the group of patients undergoing radiotherapy only. This research consists in four assessment: (1) Assessment 01: before started of radiotherapy; (2) Assessment 02: after two weeks started of RT; (3) Assessment 03: 03 months after started of RT (4) Assessment 04: 06 months after started of RT. All these assessments will be common for the participants of the research independently from the group they belong. In each assessment, images of the pelvic floor muscles will be acquired by nuclear magnetic resonance. Parallel to the MRI, there will be a clinical assessment of the patient which consist of anamnesis and physical examination, where the assessment of pelvic floor muscle function will be tested objectively using a perineometer to evaluate the peak and the mean contraction as well as the duration of the performed sustained contraction. Data will be collected from three contractions, whose mean value will be used for this study. The myoelectric activity will be evaluated using electromyography biofeedback with electromyography anal probes. The patient will also answer a quality of life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30 e PR25) and the others questionnaire: ICIQ-SF, QS-M and Jorge-Wexner Scale. The patient of TG will be included in a supervised training protocol of the pelvic floor muscles. This protocol will be conducted in conjunction with the radiotherapy sessions. The supervised muscle training will be conducted once a week with 45 minutes each session during the RT (12 weeks - 3 months). In addition to the supervised sessions, patients in this group will be instructed about the practice of home exercises and receive a guidance booklet of exercises with explanations of each exercise to be performed. These exercises must be performed daily and should be written down in the worksheet when they are performed. After this 3 month period, the patients will be encouraged to continue the exercise protocol at home without supervision. They must attend monthly to monitor adherence to home exercises. The control group (CG) patients will not be instructed to perform pelvic floor exercises, instead they will only be assessed within the stipulated time.',\n",

       "  \"The main clinical study will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, long term study involving a 100 week treatment period. The purpose of this study is to test for superiority of treatment with belimumab 10 mg/kg plus supportive therapy compared to placebo plus supportive therapy in idiopathic membranous nephropathy (IMN). The purpose of this study is also to investigate the effect of initiating earlier treatment with belimumab compared to delayed treatment with current immunosuppressive treatment regimens. The study will also determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of belimumab and further explore the mechanism of action of Belimumab as well as effects on quality of life. All subjects (on either active treatment or placebo) will receive background supportive therapy throughout the main clinical study, which includes angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and/or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) unless contraindicated and may include statins, diuretics, dietary salt restriction but excludes immunosuppressants (except low dose corticosteroids). Screening will be done within 5 to 2 weeks before the first scheduled dose of study treatment. A total of 94 evaluable subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio such that 47 subjects receive intravenous belimumab 10 mg/kg and 47 receive intravenous placebo. Subjects will be dosed on Days 0, 14, 28 and then every 4 weeks through to, and including, Week 100, resulting in a total of 27 doses (giving 104 weeks of drug exposure). The dosing frequency will be adjusted to every 2 weeks if the subject's proteinuria as assessed by urinary protein creatinine ratio (PCR) is greater than 1000mg/mmol (greater than 10 g/24 h), to compensate for loss of belimumab in the urine. Subjects who are withdrawn from study treatment at any time during the study, eg for rescue therapy, will participate in follow-up visits every 12 weeks up to week 104. A subject will be regarded as having completed the main clinical study if they complete all phases of the main clinical study (screening, treatment period, 4 week and 16 week post last dose short term safety follow-up). Subjects who complete the main clinical study will therefore participate in the main clinical study for approximately 28 months. After the main clinical study, there will be a 5 year (long term) follow-up phase to assess long term outcomes.\",\n",

       "  'Background: Cholera is a public health problem globally and in Bangladesh and its prevention is important. Despite recent availability of an effective and affordable oral cholera vaccine (OCV), its field application remains a challenge and needs to be addressed in carefully conducted research studies.There is lack of information on temperature sensitivity and resulting immunogenicity of Shanchol OCV and it is not known if administration of two doses of OCVs, one month apart, instead of currently recommended 14 days, to improve success of vaccination programme will be effective;also if one dose of the vaccine, instead of currently recommended two doses, would result in adequate immune response in population exposed to V. cholerae in an endemic country like Bangladesh. Objectives: To determine immunogenicity of Shanchol in adults. when: 1. the vaccine is stored at three defined temperatures(25 oC ,37 oC and 42oC) for 14 days, before putting back in cold box for administration in the field and compare them with the response when the vaccine is stored under currently recommended temperatures. 2. two doses of the vaccine administered one month apart and compared vaccines administered at currently recommended interval of 14 days. 3. a single dose is administered and compare them with responses after recommended two doses. Methods: The study will be conducted among adults living in the Mirpur community in urban Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh.Studying safety and acute and long-term immune responses over a period of one year. Outcome measures/variables: 1. Objective 1: safety and immunogenicity of vaccine in adults after its storage at three defined temperatures (25oC ,37oC and 42oC) by measuring vibriocidal antibody responses and compare them with the findings when the vaccine is stored at currently recommended temperature of 2-8oC (recommended by manufacturer, Shantha Biotechnic). 2. Objective 2: compare vibriocidal responses following administration of two doses of the vaccine one month apart and compare them with vaccination 14 days apart over a period of one year, with study of the memory responses over a one year period as a secondary outcome. 3. Objective 3: compare acute immune responses (vibriocidal antibody) following one and two doses of vaccine, and compare memory response as a secondary outcome measure, over a one year period. The above information is needed urgently for developing effective vaccination strategies for prevention and control of cholera in endemic countries.',\n",
       "  'Cholera remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Bangladesh and many other endemic countries in the world.The WHO recommends using the cholera vaccine in both epidemic and endemic areas to control outbreaks.An affordable oral vaccine is now available for use in endemic settings; however, successful vaccination remains challenging and expensive due to the need for temperature-controlled distribution systems, which is difficult in most developing countries.Therefore, it would be important to test heat stability of the current vaccines without significantly compromising its safety and efficacy. In cholera endemic populations their baseline immune responses and memory to the pathogen already exists. Therfore, a single dose of cholera vaccine could act as booster dose eliminating the need for the second dose, saving costs but more importantly significantly improving its delivery to large number of people within a very short time. However, that needs study in endemic countries, such as Bangladesh, to examine both acute and memory responses following a single dose and to determine how long they persist. In the developing countries such as in Bangladesh, vaccination with two doses can be problematic, with logistic and cost issues. It is also difficult to administer two doses of the vaccine after an interval of 14 days - increasing the interval to one month would be more practical and that would improve coverage of large number of populations. It would, therefore, be important to examine if immunogenicity could be increased when the second dose is administered 30 days following the first dose. Adult males and females living in the Mirpur community in urban Dhaka will be recruited in the study.The community will be informed by the field staff and interested persons will be recruited according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Eligible participants will receive Shanchol vaccine according to study design. The vaccine comes in single-dose vials and is 1.5 mL in volume. Group 1: Immunogenicity studies on temperature stability of Shanchol The vaccines will be stored at different temperatures 1a. 25°C for 14 days 1b. 37°C for 14 days and 1c. 42°C for 14 days. After that vaccine will be stored at the recommended tempature in cold chain until their administration to the participants. The second dose will be administered 14 days after the first dose, as currently recommended. These three groups will be compared to those receiving the same vaccine maintained at standard conditions of 2-8oC.We will enroll 145 participants in each of the four groups (three interventions and a control) i.e. a total of 580 eligible participants. We will measure acute responses to the vaccine by measuring vibriocidal antibodies up to a period of 28 days. Group 2a: Immunogenicity of two doses of Shanchol given 14 days apart and immunogenicity measured over a one year period Two doses of vaccines, maintained at standard storage condition (2-8oC), will be administered 14 days apart to evaluate the acute and long term immune responses.A total of 145 eligible participants will be studied in this group. We will compare acute and long term immune response among participants in this group with those in Group 2b and Group 3. Group 2b: Immunogenicity of two doses of Shanchol given 30 days apart and immunogenicity measured over a one year period Two doses of vaccines, maintained at standard storage condition (2-8oC), will be administered 30 days apart to evaluate the acute and long term immune responses. A total of 145 eligible participants will be studied in this group. We will compare acute and long term immune responses in this group with those in Group 2a and Group 3. Group 3: Immunogenicity of a single dose of Shanchol over a one year period A single dose of the vaccine, maintained at standard temperature (2-8oC), will be administered. The acute and long term immune response would be measured for a one-year period. A total of 145 participants will be enrolled in this group. We will compare immune response among particiupants in this group with those in Groups 2a and 2b. Duration of the study period for individual participants The participants in Group 1 will be followed upto 28 days, and remaining groups will be followed up to 1 year. Surveillance for adverse effects: The study participants will be monitored after the intervention to assess the safety of the study agent. After each dose of vaccine, the recipients will be followed up for 30 minutes in the clinic and then sent home if they do not have problem. Under the supervision of a clinic physician, trained Research Assistants will visit the participants in their respective homes for the next 3 cosecutive days to record adverse events such as diarrhea, vomiting, nausea and other local and systemic reactions constituting active surveillance. For the next 11 days, passive surveillance will be carried out and participants will be instructed to visit the field clinic if they have any problems. All adverse events during the study period will be recorded and the conditions managed either at the clinic or at the Dhaka Hospital of icddr, b or at other clinics/hospitals depending on the nature and severity of the condition at no costs to the participants. A clinical record form will be used to record all clinical signs and symptoms. For serious adverse events data will be entered onto a separate form. Study intervention: Oral cholera vaccine, Shanchol Each dose of the vaccine contains inactivated whole cell, heat killed and formalin killed bacteria measured as ELISA Units (EU) of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). It contains formalin-killed V. cholerae Inaba, El Tor biotype (strain Phil 6973; 600 EU); heat-killed V. cholerae Ogawa classical biotype (Cairo 50; 300 EU); formalin killed V. cholerae Ogawa classical biotype (Cairo 50; 300 EU); LPS of heat-killed V. cholerae Inaba, classical biotype (Cairo 48; 300 EU); and formalin killed V. cholerae O139 (4260B; 600 EU). Storage conditions The vaccine will be stored at 2-8°C under standard conditions (recommended) and in incubators at 25°C, 37 °C and 42°C for 14 days for the study purpose. Vaccine allocation: The study is an open study although the investigators in the laboratory carrying out the tests will be blinded as the batch of vaccine allocation they are testing. The vaccines will be allocated based on the temperature at which they have been incubated and starting from the lowest 25 oC and then going up finally to 42oC in the different sets of study participants. Each set of vaccines stored at the different temperatures will be given a code (25oC, 37oC and 42oC stored batches).',\n",

In particular, sulfonylureas may have differential effects on individuals depending on the allelic variant they carry at KCNJ11 E23K; conversely, because TCF7L2 is postulated to influence insulin secretion by regulating the action of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), and sulfonylureas act at a different step in the insulin secretion pathway, the effect of sulfonylureas on insulin secretion could be independent of genetic variation at TCF7L2. In addition, physiological responses to an insulin secretagogue or an insulin sensitizer may shed light on the mechanism of action of reported genetic associations. Despite the convincing associations of several genetic variants with type 2 diabetes and their involvement in physiological pathways involved in drug response, their impact on pharmacological interventions has not been systematically examined. The completion of the Human Genome Project and the high-density characterization of common human variation in four different ethnic groups highlight the promise of genomic medicine.

       "  'For the left-sided colorectal cancer, the investigators performed colectomy with primary anatomosis. Currently the investigators have two methods of minimal access approach to the abdominal cavity in order to complete this operation: 1. Conventional Laparoscopic colectomy The operation is completed by laparoscopic instruments using video laparoscopy. At the end of the procedure, pneumoperitoneum is abolished and a small wound was created for the delivery of bowel and insertion of anvil of the circular stapler. Finally, pneumoperitoneum is re-created for intra-corporeal anastomosis 2. Incisionless Laparoscopic Colectomy Laparoscopic colectomy is being performed in the same manner as conventional laparoscopic colectomy, except that at the end of procedure, the Transanal Endoscopic Operation (TEO) device with the outer diameter of 4cm is inserted into the anus for the delivery of specimen and insertion of anvil instead of creating a small wound as in the conventional laparoscopic colectomy. Finally, intra-corporeal anastomosis is performed in the same manner with the TEO device removed. These two operations are essentially identical except for the surgical access for the delivery of specimen and insertion of anvil. Laparoscopic colectomy and the use of Transanal Endoscopic Operation(TEO)device have been practiced in the United States and Europe for over 10 years. Large scale studies in the literature have demonstrated the safety and benefits of laparoscopic colectomy for colonic tumors and the oncological outcomes have not shown to be inferior to open approach. With the use of TEO device, the investigators can perform laparoscopic colectomy without abdominal incision for those early left-sided colonic tumors and thus it can eliminate the wound-related complications theoretically. In order to find out which one is a better procedure, the investigators are carrying out a clinical trial to compare the two surgical options in their short-term and long term outcomes.The results of this study may have an impact on the care of similar patients in the future.',\n",

       "  \"Pain is an unpleasant sensation, ranging from slight discomfort to intense suffering. Since pain is a subjective phenomenon, it has frequently defied objective, quantitative measurements. Today, in order to measure pain, subjective uni-dimensional scales are used to quantify pain. One of the most common scale used to rate a patient's pain intensity is the Numeric Pain Scale (NPS), usually scored from 0 to 100. Hitherto, those scales are based on the subjective evaluation of pain by the patient. During anesthesia the patient cannot communicate and therefore the verbal or other report is impossible. As a consequence, due to misrepresentation of the existence or extent of pain, care providers may fail to estimate the correct measure of pain and give too much or too little medication, leading to possible complications and adverse reactions. A validated scoring system of subject's pain level, or as in the case of an anaesthetised patient, subject's nociception level, is therefore needed. In this study the investigators intend to test and analyze the performances of Medasense pain response index, PRI, by comparing it with other standard pain related indicators (Heart Rate (HR), Heart Rate Variability (HRV), Skin Conductance, etc) before and after painful stimuli at different levels of analgesia. In addition, in order to reduce the variability between stimuli, a standardized stimulus (Tetanic ,30 sec, 100Hz, 60mA) will be given to all patients after sleep induction and before intubation, with and without administration of Fentanyl and the values of the PRI during these stimuli will be investigated.\",\n",

       "  \"Rationale Radiation dermatitis is a common problem in a significant proportion of breast cancer patients. In addition, radiation dermatitis is a quantifiable complication which is relatively easily observed and graded according to modified Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) criteria for toxicity. Radiation dermatitis is thought to be related to abrasion that degrades the keratinized skin surface. This results in decreased ability of skin stem cells to regenerate which leads to moist desquamation. A barrier film could potentially form a protective scaffold for new skin growth and repair. Cavilon No Sting Barrier Film (BF) has been shown in randomized trials involving post-mastectomy radiation patients to reduce the duration and frequency of radiation-induced moist desquamation. However, this treatment has not been studied in the statistically more prevalent situation of an intact breast. Therefore, we propose to investigate Cavilon to reduce side-effects of radiation treatment in intact breast cancer patients treated with conservative surgery and adjuvant radiation therapy. 2.0 STUDY OBJECTIVES 2.1 Primary Objectives To evaluate effectiveness of preventing Grade II or greater radiation dermatitis induced by adjuvant radiation therapy in women with breast cancer. The grading of dermatitis will be obtained according to modified RTOG scale for visual assessment of radiation-induced skin erythema. This is attached as Appendix A. In addition, Skin Toxicity Assessment Tool (STAT) will also be used by the patient and physician validated against the quality of life tools and toxicity tools. This is attached as Appendix B. 2.2 Secondary Objectives Quality of Life The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) will be used to measure overall quality of life. Quality of life has been considered an important contributor to overall performance status and outcome. Quality of life consists of multiple components (e.g. physical, social, and psychological aspects, etc.). Improved quality of life translates into better outcomes, especially in the context of palliation. Global quality of life was found to be significantly associated with survival in a general population of cancer patients in Canada . In fact, many clinical trials in palliative care include improved quality of life for cancer patients as a primary outcome. The EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) was developed in Europe and is frequently used to measure quality of life and its related components . The EORTC QLQ C-30 is attached in appendix C. Time to develop radiation dermatitis On each follow up visit, all patients will be assessed for development of any grade of radiation dermatitis. The time to develop grade I, II and or grade III radiation dermatitis will be calculated from the date of first dose of radiation therapy delivered to the date of visit at which the grade of dermatitis is observed. Time to additional treatment, i.e. over-the-counter or prescription interventions, will also be measured. Image An observer, blind to the regions treated by Cavilon, will also grade each paired photographic image. Qualitative Questions Qualitative questions are meant to ask personal opinion and perspectives. The answers provide further insight into the related issue or question. We have designed a very simple approach with 2-3 open-ended questions for both patient and practitioner. See Appendix D. 3.0 OVERALL STUDY DESIGN AND PLAN 3.1 Study Design Randomized paired comparison design, conducted at a single centre, the London Regional Cancer Program (LRCP), Ontario, Canada. A total of 47 patients will be accrued for this study. Eligible patients will be contacted and study details will be reviewed with them. The schedule for BF will be two times per week throughout the duration of radiation therapy. Each BF treatment will be applied immediately before radiation treatment by the radiation therapist using a film template. The template is a cellophane sheet with two quadrants physically removed. The quadrants removed will be randomly selected to receive the film spray treatment. The template is used only at the time of BF application. Other quadrants may receive standard treatment. No placebos will be used. To ensure the template is placed at the correct location for each treatment, localization will use the permanent tattoos used for radiation treatment localization. This is an intention-to-treat trial. 3.1.1 Baseline/Accrual (Visit 1) Patients with a histopathologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of breast cancer scheduled to receive adjuvant radiation therapy may be screened. The following procedures/assessments will take place during this visit for the patient: - Obtaining written informed consent - Reviewing inclusion/exclusion criteria - Obtaining disease history, including date of first diagnosis, and the history of the course of the patient's histopathologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of breast cancer, and information about prior radiation or chemotherapy - Obtaining medical history (past or concurrent clinically significant disease(s)) - Obtaining demographic data including history of radiation sensitivity or radiation sensitizers - Obtaining information about any planned treatment - Perform a general physical examination - A patient who meets all eligibility criteria will be enrolled in the study and the following additional procedures will be performed: - Completion of questionnaire for STAT, modified RTOG visual assessment of erythema, qualitative questionnaire and QLQ-C30 - Assign two of four regions by random number list 3.1.2 Treatment Phase (Weekly assessment) After the Baseline visit, patients will return to the study site for scheduled follow-up visits, also called Patient Review (PR). The following procedures/assessments will be performed during these visits: - Evaluation and documentation of any grade radiation dermatitis using STAT and the modified RTOG erythema scale - Documentation of any new medication use including use of skin creams 3.1.3 Follow-up Visit (One week post treatment completion) The following procedures/assessments will be performed during the follow-up visit: - Evaluation and documentation of any grade radiation dermatitis - Completion of questionnaire for QLQ-C30 - Completion of qualitative questions - Completion of global questionnaire 4.0 SELECTION OF STUDY POPULATION The study will be conducted in patients with histopathologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of breast cancer, scheduled to receive adjuvant radiation therapy as outpatients at the London Health Sciences Centre, London, Ontario. 5.0 STATISTICAL EVALUATION 5.1 Determination of Sample Size The primary endpoint will be a comparison of region 1 (region treated with standard care) and region 2 (region treated with BF). Based on the same endpoint measure, we estimate the baseline/standard care risk of grade 2 toxicity and higher to be approximately 60% at any point during the assessment period. Studies with the same and similar products demonstrate an expected reduction of grade 2 or higher toxicity to approximately 30%. This is also a clinically important significant difference . The sample size required is 42 (paired analysis). This assumes a Type I error of 0.05 and a power of 80% to reject the null hypothesis. With an expected 5% excess added due to loss to follow up or non-evaluable data, we would require a sample size of 47 patients. This is consistent with landmark Uppsala randomized study demonstrating the value of corticosteroid cream with 42 patients. 5.2 Statistical Analysis SAS (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used to generate a random allocation list with two stratification blocks (i. chemo no chemo; ii. breast separation).The physician will be unaware of the treatment allocation, but the patient and radiation therapist administering the film will not be blinded. For qualitative measures, McNemar's (McNemar) chi-square test for paired proportions will be used. For quantitative measures, a paired t-test or a signed rank test will be used. For the 'time to event' variables that will be paired, Kaplan Meier estimates to graphically demonstrate the 'time to event' will be used. The statistical comparisons will be performed using proportional hazards models with a sandwich estimator to account for the pairing with a sandwich estimator. A repeated measures ANOVA will be used to assess the four quadrants. If the data is poorly distributed then we will take a median of the two treated areas and two control areas and apply a singed rank test. Note that this is not the principle endpoint of the trial. The principle endpoint of the trial is a 1-to-1 comparison of the BF treated area and the area treated using standard options. A multivariable analysis will be performed to determine factors impacting on skin toxicity. The multivariable analysis will not be used for between patient comparisons as differences will be accounted for by the pairing. All significant tests will be two-sided and performed at the 5% level.\",\n",

       "  'A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind, Multinational, Placebo-Controlled Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy in Diminishing Insulin Requirements Utilizing Oral Cyclosporine With Oral Lansoprazole in Children and Adults With Existing Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus',\n",
       "  'The purpose of this study is to determine if oral Cyclosporine A and oral Lansoprazole are effective in rendering patients with existing type 1 diabetes, insulin independent. This two-arm study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy for insulin independence by utilizing the FDA-approved oral immune tolerance agent, Cyclosporine A, and the FDA-approved proton-pump inhibitor, Lansoprazole. Lansoprazole and other proton-pump inhibitors increase gastrin levels. Gastrin was initially shown to have the potential to increase new beta cell formation in 1955 (Zollinger RM and Ellison EH. Ann Surg. 1955;142(4):709-23). Studies with the immune tolerance agent, Cyclosporine A, previously demonstrated that among recently diagnosed type 1 diabetes patients, insulin independence was achieved in as many as 67.5% of patients within 7 weeks of therapy (Bougneres PF et al. N Engl J Med. 1988:17;318(11):663-70). Cyclosporine A protected the remaining beta cells from further autoimmune attack, but over time, there was limited beta cell regeneration, and insulin was ultimately required by all patients. Therefore, this study proposes the usage of Cyclosporine A with a beta regeneration agent. Follow-up studies for up to 13 years among 285 type 1 patients utilizing Cyclosporine A for 20 months, did not demonstrate renal or other side effects (Assan R. et al. Diabetes Metab Res Rev. 2002;18(6):464-72). Human clinical trials with gastrin and epidermal growth factor demonstrated reductions in daily insulin requirements by much as 75% within 3 months following four weeks of therapy among existing type 1 diabetes patients (Transition Therapeutics, March 5, 2007 http://www.transitiontherapeutics.com/media/archive.php Accessed January 1, 2013). Lack of the ability to sustain these results was likely due to the ongoing autoimmune attack on the new beta cells generated by therapy. Gastrin alone has been shown to induce beta cell neogenesis from human pancreatic ductal tissue without epidermal growth factor in in vitro studies (Suarez-Pinzon WL et al. JCEM. 2005;90(6):3401-3409). Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease. Despite evidence that many different immune tolerance agents have successfully reversed diabetes in rodent type 1 models, none have been successful in sustaining insulin independence in man (Ablamunits V et al. Ann NY Acad Sci. 2007;1103:19-32). The distinctions and complexities of islets in man are far different than that of rodents (Levetan CS and Pierce SM. Endocr Pract. 2012 Nov 27:1-36 Epub ahead of print). We hypothesize that in man, both an immune tolerance agent and a beta regeneration agent are required to sustain insulin independence. Based upon proton-pump inhibitors having been shown to increase plasma gastrin levels up to 10-fold, this clinical trial utilizes the oral proton-pump inhibitor, Lansoprazole. This study will determine the safety and efficacy of Cyclosporine A used with and without Lansoprazole to determine the impact on insulin independence among patients with existing type 1 diabetes. Cyclosporine A is utilized to protect the new beta cells formed by Lansoprazole. The combination of the two therapies may render reductions in insulin requirements and have a greater impact on sustained insulin independence than previously reported with Cyclosporine A or gastrin alone among type 1 patients.A This 52-week study consists of two treatment arms designed to assess the safety and efficacy of achieving insulin independence using: - Oral Lansoprazole/Oral Cyclosporine A - Oral Placebo/Oral Placebo It is hypothesized that the combination of oral Cyclosporine A and oral Lansoprazole will safely render significantly more patients with existing type 1 diabetes, insulin independent and may serve as a novel and innovative treatment approach for patients with type 1 diabetes utilizing two FDA-approved therapies.',\n",

Therefore, it is important to evaluate the ovarian reserve with specific marker to have a better prediction of the response of the in vitro fertilization treatment and to have a better rate of pregnancy. Until now, a lot of clinical criteria (age, duration of the infertility, number of antral follicles) and biological (FSH, Oestradiol, Inhibin B, EFFORT test, number of the eggs at the retrieval day) was suggested to help for the estimation of the ovarian reserve. Since couple of years, the anti-müllerian hormone (AMH) is recognize to be one of the best ovarian reserve marker, it corresponding the number of antral follicles, it is more sensitive and predictive. Moreover, during the In-Vitro Fertilization, the anti-müllerian hormone can provide the weak responds at the stimulation and the reverse, the risk of excessive responds (hyperstimulation). To choose the gonadotropin doses to administrate (stimulation ovarian hormone) during an In-Vitro Fertilization protocol, we need to know the anti-müllerian hormone dosage. However, if the anti-müllerian hormone is recognize to evaluate the quantity of available eggs in the ovaries, his role to determine the quality of these eggs still discussed.

We postulated that the use of low TV during OLV for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) would decrease the extravascular lung water content index (EVLWI). After local ethics committee approval and informed consent, we will randomly allocate 60 patients scheduled for elective VATS to ventilate the dependent lung with VT of 4, 6, or 8 mL/kg (n= 20 for each), I: E ratio 1: 2.5, PEEP of 5 cm H2O, recruitment maneuvers and respiratory rate will be adjusted to maintain normocapnia. Perioperative changes in EVLWI, hemodynamics, oxygenation index will be recorded. Also, the incidence of postoperative ALI, morbidity, hospitalization and mortality will be recorded',\n",
       "  \"Nowadays most thoracic procedures are performed via video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) which necessitates the use of one lung ventilation (OLV). Acute lung injury (ALI) is the most serious pulmonary complication after lung resection which may be aggravated with the use of large tidal volume (TV) and high peak airway pressures (Paw) during one-lung ventilation (OLV). In a large multicenter trial included 861 patients at 10 university centers of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Network of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, the use of lower tidal volumes from 4 to 6 ml/kg of the predicted body weight (PBW) during ventilation in patients with acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome may reduce injurious lung stretch, the release of inflammatory mediators, days of mechanical ventilation and mortality (P=0.007). By the late 1990s the standard VT for managing thoracic surgical patients had already been adjusted downwards [from 10 to 12 ml/kg in the 1980s] to 8 to 10 ml/kg, although no specific guidelines existed for one-lung ventilation. The implementation of lung protective strategy during OLV using low TV [5-6 ml/kg PBW], pressure-controlled ventilation, limiting inspiratory plateau pressures and adding end-expiratory positive pressure (PEEP) with or without recruitment maneuvers has been shown to attenuate the incidence of ALI by 76-82% and satisfactory gas exchange after lung surgery without inducing a possible inflammatory/remodeling response. The use of lower tidal volumes for OLV with subsequently decreased peak airway pressures may be associated with less production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule (sICAM)-1.8 Recent data have highlighted the role of extra vascular lung water index (EVLWI) as a useful good parameter for early diagnosis of pulmonary complication including acute lung injury after thoracic surgery. The diagnosis of postoperative ALI is often delayed because clinical signs of pulmonary edema present only once the extra vascular lung water (EVLW) exceeds 7 ml/kg (ideal body weight). EVLWI may be measured with thermal dilution pulse index continuous cardiac output (PiCCO) (pulse contour cardiac output, Pulsion Medical Systems; Munich, Germany). The EVLWI represents both interstitial and alveolar fluid. Many studies used the ratio of EVLWI and the intrathoracic blood volume (ITBV) within the lungs to derive the pulmonary vascular permeability index. A high EVLW/ITBV ratio will support an increased permeability as the cause of ALI, whereas a low ratio will suggest hydrostatic pulmonary edema. Up to our knowledge, there is no available study of the efficacy of low tidal volumes during OLV in reducing the EVLWI, incidence of acute lung injury and the hospital cost of stay after thoracoscopic surgery. The investigators assume that the changes in tidal volume during OLV by 1 ml/kg (e.g. 70 ml in a 70 kg body weight patient) make no sense. So, they hypothesize that the use of lower tidal volumes of 4 ml/kg and 6 ml/kg will be associated with less lung water content than the use of larger tidal volume of 8 ml/kg. Interventions: In all patients, standard monitors including three leads electrocardiograph, noninvasive pressure and pulse oximeter, will be applied, fentanyl (1.0 μg/kg) and midazolam (0.03 mg/kg) will be given and femoral artery will be catheterized with a 5 Fr. Thermodilution catheter under local anesthesia and will be connected to a computer for pulse contour monitor (PiCCO2, Pulsion Medical Systems; Munich, Germany). This catheter will be used for blood gasometry and beat to beat monitoring of arterial blood pressure. Anesthetic technique will be standardized in all studied patients. Anesthesiologists who will give the anaesthetic will be not involved in the patient's assessment. General anaesthesia will be induced with propofol (2-3 mg/kg), fentanyl (2-3 µg/kg), and cisatracurium (0.2 mg/kg) will be given to facilitate tracheal intubation with a left-sided double-lumen tube (DLT). The correct position of its tip will be confirmed with a fiberoptic bronchoscope after intubation and after positioning the patient in the lateral decubitus position (LDP). Anesthesia will be maintained with sevoflurane 1-1.5 MAC and fentanyl increments of 0.5 µg/kg to maintain the response entropy (RS) values < 50 and the difference between RE and state entropy (SE) < 10. Suppression of the second twitch in the train-of-four stimulation of the ulnar nerve will be maintained with 0.03 mg/kg increments of cisatracurium. The patients' lungs will be mechanically ventilated using fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 0.5 in air, tidal volume (VT) of 8 mL/kg (predicted body weight), inspiratory to expiratory [I: E] ratio of 1:2.5, a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cm H2O, respiratory rate (R.R) will be adjusted to achieve an PaCO2 of 35-45 mm Hg, peak inspiratory pressures (Ppk) will be limited to 35 cm H2O and a low fresh gas flow (FGF) (<2 L/min) in a semi closed circuit system. A central venous catheter will be inserted in the right internal jugular vein with ultrasonography guidance. EVLWI and ITBV will be calculated with the PiCCO2 monitor. Three 20 ml blouses of iced saline will be injected through the central venous catheter and the change in the temperature will be measured with the thermistor-tipped femoral arterial catheter. All operations will be performed by the same surgeons. The VATS procedure will begin with the exploration of the pleural cavity using a 30° video thoracoscopic camera through a 1.5-cm single skin incision with the use of 1-3 trocars which enables the thoracoscopic instruments to move the lung. Intraoperative fluid therapy will include intravenous infusion of 2 ml/kg/hour of Lactated Ringer's solution and blood losses will be compensated with colloids and with red blood cell concentrates if the hemoglobin levels decreases below 8 to 9 g/dL. Mean arterial blood pressure will be maintained greater than 60 mm Hg using boluses of ephedrine 5 mg or phenylephrine 100 ug. Urine output will be maintained greater than 0.5 ml/kg/hour. At the end of surgery, the nondependent will be re-expanded and TLV will be resumed as before surgery. At the end of surgery, sevoflurane will be discontinued, the residual neuromuscular block will be antagonized, and the patient will be extubated. Postoperative analgesia will be accomplished with the use of patient-controlled morphine analgesia, lornoxicam and paracetamol. A restrictive fluid and transfusion policy will be adopted throughout the study periods, with targeted fluid balance of maximum 500 ml/day and transfusion triggers ranging between 8 and 9 g/dL. The development of ALI, defined according to the American-European Consensus Conference criteria as sudden onset of respiratory distress within the first 48 hours after surgery; infiltrates on the chest radiograph consistent with pulmonary edema; impaired oxygenation with an PaO2/FIO2 ratio less than 300 mmHg for ALI; and absence of cardiac insufficiency or fluid overload, based on PICCO2, echocardiogram and/or clinical evaluation Statistical Analysis: Data will be tested for normality using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Fisher exact test will be used for categorical data. Repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference post hoc tests will be used to evaluate the effects of time, group, and interaction in the continuous data of the primary (EVLWI and EVLWI/LTBV ratio) and secondary endpoints in each group. Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA and posthoc Wilcoxon rank sum tests will be done for intergroup comparisons for the nonparametric variables. univariate analysis for the risk factors for increases in EVLWI after OLV for VATS will be done including age, sex, preoperative pulmonary function, duration of surgery and OLV, tidal volume, and FiO2.

For our research, we will select adult patients, both genders, affected with suspected NCWS (i.e. with symptoms/signs which disappeared on GFD and worsen on a gluten containing diet, testing negative for celiac disease [anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies, anti-tTG, and anti-endomysium antibodies, EMA, and with biopsy Marsh 0-1] and wheat allergy [serum specific IgE for wheat]). The patients will be recruited at the Department of Internal Medicine, \\'Giovanni Paolo II\\' Hospital of Sciacca (Agrigento), and of Internal Medicine of the University of Palermo, from January 2012 to October 2013, for IBS-like symptoms. At the time of the recruitment, the patients will be on GFD by at least one month and must be asymptomatic. A more restricted elimination diet (with the exclusion of cow\\'s milk, egg and other foods) could be prescribed in patients who are suspected to suffer from multiple food hypersensitivity. The patients will be randomized to undergo a double-blind placebo-controlled study, assuming wheat flour or placebo, administered daily for 15 days. Before and after the challenge, the investigators will evaluate gastrointestinal (Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale, GSRS) and the investigators will collect blood sampling and biopsies from endoscopic evaluation (both esophagogastroduodenoscopy and rectoscopy, with multiple biopsies), for the identification of possible markers (serological, biochemical, immunological, histological features, expression of cytokines and other constitutive mucosal proteins from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and mucosal lymphocytes) that may be of help to diagnose the condition of NCWS and to understand its pathogenesis.',\n",
       "  'Gluten is the most important protein component of some grains, notably wheat, rye, and barley, which are the basis for a variety of wheat-derived alimentary products consumed throughout the world (bread, pasta, pizza etc). However the \"engineering\" of gluten-containing grains created the conditions for human diseases related to gluten exposure. These forms of gluten intolerance represent a heterogeneous set of conditions, including celiac disease, wheat allergy and gluten sensitivity (GS), that, combined, seems to affect about 10% of the general population. The frequency of not-celiac GS is however still unknown, even though it is possible that this condition have been undiagnosed and under-diagnosed by the physicians for a long time. The immune responsiveness to wheat antigens represents a complex process, and its establishment and maintenance are not completely elucidated. The most frequent diseases caused by wheat ingestion are T cell-mediated disorders, i.e. celiac disease and IgE-mediated allergic reactions. However, besides celiac disease and wheat allergy, there are cases of gluten reactions in which neither autoimmune nor IgE-mediated allergic mechanisms are involved. These are generally defined as GS. Some subjects, who experience symptoms when eating gluten-containing products and show improvement when following a gluten-free diet (GFD), may have GS instead of celiac disease or wheat allergy. GS patients are unable to tolerate gluten and develop an adverse reaction when eating gluten, that, usually, and differently from celiac disease, does not lead to small intestinal damage. Gastrointestinal symptoms in GS patients may resemble those associated with celiac disease, but the overall clinical picture is generally less severe and is not accompanied by the occurrence of autoantibodies (i.e. anti-tTG or EMA) or autoimmune disease (i.e. Hashimoto\\'s thyroiditis). Typically, the diagnosis is made by exclusion, and an elimination diet and an \"open challenge\" (i.e., the monitored reintroduction of gluten-containing foods) are most often used to evaluate whether health improves or worsen with the elimination or reintroduction of gluten in the diet, respectively. Gluten-sensitivity can cause both gastrointestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms; among the former, the most frequent are IBS-like symptoms including abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, constipation and alternate bowel habit. However, as it is not known what component of the cereals causes the symptoms in so called \"gluten-sensitive\" patients, we prefer to speak of \"Not-celiac wheat sensitivity\" (NCWS). Furthermore, in our experience, NCWS patients can suffer from multiple food hypersensitivity and need of a more restricted diet with the elimination of cow\\'s milk, egg and other foods, in addition to wheat. For these reasons, before to undergo the gluten challenge, the patients will undergo an oligoantigenic diet. This study has two major aims: 1. Evaluation of the effective dependence from the wheat of the IBS-like manifestations presented by subjects with suspected GS. The study will be done after a period of GFD, comparing two groups of suspected NCWS subjects: administering wheat flour or placebo (for 15 days). 2. Identification of possible markers (serological, biochemical, immunological, histological features, expression of cytokines and other constitutive mucosal proteins from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and mucosal lymphocytes) that may be of help to diagnose the condition of NCWS. In particular, the investigators will search for markers of NCWS in the colon mucosa of the patients with IBS-like symptoms.',\n",

This multi-centre and open-label study comprises two groups corresponding to tested root canal sealer (a reference product and investigational product). Randomization is required. Investigational product that is a dental cement based on biosilicate technology (PA0903) will be applied with lateral compaction or single cone technique. On the contrary, reference product that is a zinc oxide-eugenol used in dental practice (Pulp Canal Sealer) will be applied with a single wave technique. Study start: 01/12/11 Inclusion period: 24 months Study duration: 2 years after the end of inclusion period OBJECTIVES: The trial objective is to illustrate the clinical and radiographic outcome of PA0903 in the described indication. Primary objectives: The primary objective is to evaluate: clinical and radiographic outcome of root canal treatment at two years when using PA0903 as an endodontic sealer with gutta-percha. The success rate is defined as no pain (score of 0 at the VAS scale) and absence or decrease in the size of LEO (fulfilment of Strindberg's criteria). If a pre-existing lesion, the size decrease associated with normal contours, width and structure of the periodontal margines is considered as success. All cases in which lesion increases or is stabilized after 2 years were judged as unsuccessful . Moreover, all cases in which Strindberg's criteria if they are suitable were not fulfilled were judged as unsuccessful. A follow-up of two years is described as the predictive time of success. Secondary objective: The secondary objectives are to evaluate the following criteria and in an indicative way, to compare them between patients receiving the PA0903 and those receiving the reference product: - The success rate at each time point and also the components of this composite variable (i.e. pain and Healing process for total class (vital teeth and necrotic teeth) of endodontic status of teeth). In case of pre-existing LEO associated with necrotic teeth, size of LEO and suitable Strindgberg's criteria will be used to judge the outcomes of the root canal therapy as described below : At visit 2 (6 months) treatment is considered successful when LEO is stable or decreased in comparison with V0 associated with Strindberg's criteria suitable. At V3 (1 year), treatment is considered successful when LEO is decreased in comparison with V2 associated with Strindberg's criteria suitable. - the Healing process associated with PA0903 application in each endodontic status - the handling, consistency and physical characteristics of PA0903 - the longevity and safety of the product associated with PA0903 after two years.

       "  'The use of radiation therapy to treat metastatic tumors is well established and promising data are emerging with the use of SBRT for metastatic disease. However, the use of a single large fraction concurrent with a radiosensitizer as is being proposed is not of proven benefit. This investigation aims to confirm the safety and efficacy for SBRT used concurrently with a radiosensitizer in the setting of oligometastatic disease. The dose selected has been chosen with the belief that it is safe and effective based on prior experience with SBRT of lung cancer, pancreatic cancer and brain radiosurgery. All patients will be treated with a single fraction (per lesion site), targeted to the lesion concurrently with the radiosensitizer Nelfinavir. On the basis of this preclinical evidence, we propose a phase II study of Nelfinavir combined with SBRT in patients with oligometastatic disease. Because the standard dose of Nelfinavir for HIV patients is known to be safe and does inhibit the phosphorylation of Akt and decrease tumor hypoxia, we propose to study this in conjunction with a 15 Gy dose of SBRT. Experience with single-fraction pulmonary and pancreas SBRT provides a useful dose for this trial. With published data establishing the relative safety of large single-fraction SBRT to the lungs and pancreas, we have decided to proceed to determine the safety of 15 Gy SBRT concurrently with the radiosensitizer Nelfinavir. Once this is established, we propose to continue to enroll more patients to the study at this dose to determine the efficacy of this type of therapy. The proposed study represents an informed estimate based on current knowledge of SBRT doses and those administered in currently approved image-guided protocols (brain, base of skull, cervico-thoracic spine, pancreas and liver). This study will refine the current understanding of single fraction radiation tolerance for normal tissues, thereby making it possible to treat future patients more safely and aggressively.',\n",

       "  \"Background: Crohn's disease is clearly on the rise in countries exposed to industrialization and western diet. Several factors may implicate diet in the pathogenesis of CD or in disease activity. The strongest argument for an effect of diet is the effect of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) on disease activity in CD. 40-80% of children , fed an exclusive liquid diet, irrespective of which diet, will enter complete remission, often with normalization of inflammatory markers. The effect of formula has been shown to be independent of fat or protein composition in pediatric studies, but to be dependent on exclusion of normal diet.Thus, rather than the composition of EEN being associated with remission of disease it may be the exclusion of certain components of the Western diet may be responsible for improvement. Methods:This is a prospective randomized controlled trial, in patients with a recent diagnosis of CD (up to two years),aged 4-18, comparing two arms over 12 weeks of therapy. Group 1:will receive 50% of their dietary needs from a polymeric formula ( Modulen, Nestle) and a limited whole food diet for 6 weeks/ Group 2: will receive EEN with Modulen for 6 weeks. At the end of 6 weeks, all patients entering remission (irrespective of randomization) will enter the second 6 week phase, continuing 25 % of calories as Modulen in both groups. Patients in remission from group 2 will continue to consume 25% of calories as Modulen and be allowed free diet , patients in Group 1 will continue 25% of calories from Modulen but continue restricted diet. Patients will be seen at onset (week 0), weeks 3 and 6, 12 and 24 weeks. We hypothesize that by withdrawing the offending dietary agents we can achieve an equal remission rate with improved tolerability. This study will evaluate response, remission and tolerability in both groups, as well as the effects of nutrition on bone health.\",\n",

Liver transplantation is the only available life saving treatment for patients with end stage liver disease. However, lack of donors, surgical complications, rejection, and high cost are serious problems. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) possess plasticity and have the potential to differentiate into hepatocyte; Thus, MSCs hold great hope for therapeutic applications. Human umbilical cord-derived MSCs (hUC-MSCs) exhibit a more beneficial immunogenic profile and greater overall immunosuppressive potential than aged bone marrow-derived MSCs.

Based on the animal studies, only 10-15% of intravenously transplanted stem cells migrate to haematopoietic sites while the rest is lost in other organs. Results of studies of direct intrabone allogenic cord-blood cells transplantation in humans confirm that this route of transplantation is associated with less probability of graft failure and moreover may reduce risk of graft-versus-host disease and malignancy relapse.

       "  'The goal of this study is to collect blood samples from the umbilical cords of newborn babies, as soon as they are delivered, and to place these samples in the MD Anderson Cord Blood Bank. Your sample may be included in the National Cord Blood Inventory (NCBI) which is part of the CW Bill Young Cell Transplantation Program. The NCBI is a federally-supported program to assist in the collection of cord blood. Cord blood will be made available to patients through The National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP). These samples may then be offered to MD Anderson and other institutions for patients who need a bone marrow transplant and do not have a donor. The MD Anderson Cord Blood Bank will have the rights to release cord blood units to these institutions around the world according to established bone marrow transplant donor criteria, for a fee to cover costs. Cord blood samples that are collected and then do not meet the clinical requirements for patient use may also be used at MD Anderson or other institutions either for research or for quality purposes to improve cord blood banking procedures. If not suitable for patient use or for research purposes, the cord blood unit may be thrown away.',\n",
       "  \"The blood in an unborn baby's umbilical cord contains blood-making cells that could help treat another person with a life-threatening disease. These cord blood cells may provide cells for transplants given to patients with marrow diseases such as leukemia. These cord blood transplants can be done when a patient's cell type (human leukocyte antigen, or HLA, type) matches the cord blood type. 'Cord blood' is normally thrown away with the umbilical cord and placenta after the baby is born. Collection of the cord blood takes place after your new baby is born and the umbilical cord has been clamped and cut in the normal way. The collection of cord blood takes place from the part of the cord that is still connected to the placenta, not to your new baby. The cord blood may be collected 'in-utero': after your baby is delivered but the placenta is still inside the uterus, or it may be collected 'ex-utero': after the placenta is delivered. The choice of which method of collection is performed will depend on the preference of your obstetrician/midwife. Neither method puts you or your baby at any risk of injury. Once the cord blood is drawn, it becomes the property of the MD Anderson Cord Blood Bank, and you will not retain any residual interests or rights to this sample. During the delivery of your baby, your obstetrician has your health and that of your newborn baby as his or her main concern. If you agree to take part in this study, your doctor and/or the Cord Blood Bank staff will try to collect the cord blood, but your doctor's main concern will be the well being of you and your baby. Circumstances may arise which prevent the collection of your cord blood. The cord blood that is collected will be taken to the MD Anderson Cord Blood Bank Laboratory, where it will be tested or sent out for testing to laboratories accredited for doing those tests as described below. Just like the donation of blood for transfusion, it is important that cord blood does not carry any infections that can be passed on. When volunteers donate blood to a blood bank, they are asked to fill out a confidential questionnaire about their risks for some infections (like acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis, and/or malaria). You will be asked questions like these in a questionnaire. You will also be asked some questions about your family medical history, to check for the chance of an inherited disease that could be passed on with the cord blood. This questionnaire will be completed within 48 hours of your baby being born, and will take about 15 minutes to complete. This questionnaire is used for screening purposes, and may result in your cord blood not being suitable for patient use, in which case the cord blood may be used for research purposes, for quality purposes (to improve cord blood banking procedures), or discarded. Your medical chart, and that of your infant, will be reviewed to help determine whether you may have a disease which could be inherited and thus transmitted with the cord blood to a transplant patient who receives it. Additionally, you will be asked about your family ethnic/racial background; this information is used to help match the cord blood to the patients. A blood sample (about 2 tablespoonfuls) will be drawn from you to test for infectious diseases including HIV, human T cell Iymphotrophic virus (HTLV), Hepatitis B and C, cytomegalovirus (CMV), West Nile Virus (WNV), Trypanosoma cruzi (T cruzi, a parasitic organism that causes Chagas disease) and syphilis. The cord blood unit itself may also be tested for HIV, HTLV, Hepatitis B and C, CMV, WNV, T. cruzi, syphilis, for bacterial and fungal infection, and for the blood type (ABO/Rh). This testing will be performed at accredited testing laboratories. Small samples of your blood and the cord blood (about 2 teaspoonfuls each) will also be frozen and stored separately to screen for diseases in the future. If you are delivering your baby in Texas, as per Texas state law, a blood sample will be taken from your baby by the hospital staff and will be sent to the Department of State Health Services to be tested for inherited diseases, known as 'Newborn Screening'. You will be asked to sign a release form which will allow the Department of State Health Services to release these Newborn screening results to the MD Anderson Cord Blood Bank. Since such diseases may be passed on through transplant, your donated cord blood unit will not be banked if positive results are received. The Department of State Health Services will notify your physician of positive or unclear Newborn screening results. In addition, the cord blood unit and sometimes the maternal blood sample will be tested for its HLA type which will be used to identify matches with the transplant patient who needs the cord blood. This testing will be performed at MD Anderson. A small sample of the cord blood unit will be sent to the Stemcyte and City of Hope Laboratories in California for more sophisticated typing to determine whether the cord blood unit might be useful in treating AIDS patients. Both your blood and your cord blood are tested for infections, because there are rare instances where an infection could be found in the mother's blood and yet it has not been found in the cord blood. It is also possible although uncommon, that an infection could be found in the cord blood but not in the mother's blood. If the volume of your donated cord blood is not large enough for banking, testing may not be performed. All information you provide, as well as the identity of you and your new baby will be kept as confidential as possible, to the fullest extent allowed by law. While the MD Anderson Cord Blood Bank has to maintain a link between the cord blood unit and information identifying you, multiple levels of security will protect this. When the information and blood samples are collected, they will be given a unique sample number. Nobody except the Principal Investigator and those designated by the Principal Investigator will have access to any of your personal information. If your cord blood is released to another institution for transplant, there will be no way to determine you were the donor as we keep your identity anonymous. If your donated cord blood cells are used in a transplant, the recipient of your cord blood cells will not be able to access any of your personal information. At the time of donation, you will be asked to provide MD Anderson Cord Blood Bank an address for you and your physician. If any unclear or positive results are found during the testing of your blood or the cord blood (such as HIV, HTLV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, WNV, Chagas and/or syphilis), the MD Anderson Cord Blood Bank will notify your physician using the information you have provided to the Cord Blood Bank. As required by Texas law a confirmed positive or unclear test for HIV/AIDS or syphilis from your blood or the cord blood will be reported to the Texas Department of State Health Services. Additionally, the Houston Department of Health and Human Services will be notified of any positive West Nile Virus results, and they may contact you to conduct a confidential interview to help track community risk to WNV. The Cord Blood Bank may also contact you directly, using the contact information you provide, in order to obtain updated information about your child's health regarding inherited disorders and/or communicable diseases, or to request additional information or clarification of information contained in the Cord Blood Bank file. If you become aware of any changes in your baby's health which may affect the suitability of the donated cord blood unit for transplantation, it is important that you contact the Cord Blood Bank at 713-563-8000. The cord blood will be tested and frozen. Cord blood units that meet clinical specifications will be stored in the MD Anderson Cord Blood Bank, listed on the stem cell donor registries and may be released to MD Anderson or other institutions in the US or around the world following established criteria for bone marrow transplant donors, for a fee to cover handling charges. These institutions will use the cord blood for patients needing a bone marrow transplant. Any fresh or stored cord blood units donated to the Cord Blood Bank that do not meet all the clinical specifications (for example, if they are too small or have bacterial contamination), and cannot be used for patients needing a bone marrow transplant, they may be discarded or used for research or in studies to improve the cord blood banking procedures, either at MD Anderson or at other institutions. Before your cord blood can be used for research, the people doing the research must get specific approval from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of MD Anderson or the IRB of the institution where the research will be performed. The IRB is a committee made up of doctors, researchers, and members of the community. The IRB is responsible for protecting the participants involved in research studies and making sure all research is done in a safe and ethical manner. All research performed at MD Anderson, including research involving your cord blood from this bank, must first be approved by the IRB. The cord blood units will be used on a first come, first served basis. At the time of donation, you will be given the address and phone number of the MD Anderson Cord Blood Bank. In the unlikely event that you or another immediate family member develop a disease which would require the use of your donated cord blood, it may be released to you on the same basis that it would be provided to other qualifying patients, if it is still under the control of the MD Anderson Cord Blood Bank and has not already been committed to a patient. You should contact the MD Anderson Cord Blood Bank within one month of collection if you wish to have your donated cord blood unit destroyed. If requested, the research staff will destroy your cord blood unit if it has not been used for research, Cord Blood Bank validation studies or quality control. After this one month period has passed, your cord blood unit will be made available for patient use and you will be unable to request that it be destroyed. This is an investigational study. Up to 250,000 women will take part in this study. All will be enrolled through MD Anderson.\",\n",

       "  'In Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom (OIF/OEF), over 60% of combat casualties have been the result of explosive blasts, and many of these critical injuries involve trauma to the head. As a result, traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been deemed a \"signature wound\" of OIF and OEF. The symptoms of head injuries, particularly of concussion/mild TBI (mTBI), can be sever but subtle, suggesting that early and accurate diagnosis is paramount to a wounded warrior\\'s appropriate medical care. Most first providers in the war theater are medics who could benefit from an improved diagnostic test to better identify service members with concussion/mTBI. The MACE cognitive test is heavily weighted towards memory, is not 100% specific, and does not preclude a diagnosis of concussion being rendered despite a score in the normal range. Thus, an objective test of neurocognitive function, such as the DANA Rapid, that can be rapidly administered in theater by a combat medic would be highly beneficial to accurate clinical diagnosis and timely treatment. The results of the present study will provide information on the predictive value of the newly developed DANA handheld computer in assisting in the diagnosis of concussion in service members who have been blast exposed. If the DANA Rapid exam proves to be equally or more accurate than the MACE in detecting cognitive deficits, these tests and the handheld computer will also contribute to improved health care for service members by minimizing the time between injury and diagnosis.',\n",

       "  'This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of entolimod in treating patients with stage III-IV or recurrent head and neck cancer. Biological therapies, such as entolimod, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from growing. Entolimod may also prevent side effects caused by chemotherapy with cisplatin and radiation therapy. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving entolimod together with cisplatin and radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells',\n",
       "  'PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To define the Phase II dose of CBLB502 (entolimod) when given as weekly injections during irradiation with cisplatin, for patients with poor prognosis advanced squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck receiving chemoradiotherapy. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To describe the adverse event (AE) profile and the dose limiting toxicities of CBLB502 when administered weekly in combination with cisplatin and radiation therapy. II. To determine the maximally tolerated dose (if observed) of CBLB502 in combination with cisplatin and radiation therapy. III. To describe the pharmacokinetics (PK) of CBLB502 when administered in combination with cisplatin. IV. To describe the pharmacodynamics (PD) of CBLC502 by examining plasma levels of various cytokines, including filgrastim (granulocyte-colony stimulating factor [G-CSF]), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). V. To describe any clinical activity of CBLB502 in the form of mitigation of mucositis. VI. To describe the response rate to chemoradiotherapy in combination with CBLB502.

It is caused by autonomous secretion of aldosterone, encompassing a group of disorders which is for 99% predominated by unilateral aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) and bilateral adrenal hyperplasia (BAH). Diagnosis of PA is relevant for two reasons: 1. independent of the level of blood pressure, hypertension due to autonomous aldosterone secretion causes more cardiovascular damage than essential hypertension; 2. PA requires specific treatment: adrenalectomy in case of APA and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) in case of BAH.

Given this high prevalence of PA, as well as the amount of cardiovascular damage and the available specific treatment, the question is raised whether screening of PA should be introduced in Dutch general practice. To answer this important question, several issues with regard to PA need to be elucidated: 1. International studies report a prevalence of PA in general practice of 6-13%. Prevalence in the Dutch population is still unknown; 2. Because of underdiagnosis of PA and long delay in diagnosis of PA after recognition of hypertension (mean eight years), data on characteristics of early diagnosed PA are lacking. Proof of early cardiovascular damage would strengthen the case of screening for PA and needs to be studied; 3. Consequently, the diagnostic delay has lead to lack of data on optimal treatment in early PA. In the current guideline (NHG-guideline 'Cardiovascular risk management') a regimen of antihypertensive drugs is advised, and only if hypertension is refractory for >6 months patients are referred. It is unknown if hypertension is resistant to therapy in the initial phase of PA. If not, this would also argue for early biochemical screening for PA, because even if blood pressure is controlled, the detrimental effect of aldosterone itself will go on unopposed. It is therefore required to study the response to antihypertensive drugs (not MRA) in these patients.\",\n",

The investigators hypothesize that participants will lose 7% of their body weight. The research is being done because many women who are treated for breast cancer are overweight and treatment for breast cancer is often accompanied by weight gain. Individuals who are overweight may be more likely to have their breast cancer come back. Also women who exercise at least three hours a week seem to have less chance of their cancer coming back. The investigators hope to identify an effective weight loss and exercise intervention for breast cancer survivors that can be easily accessed by many people. This study is designed to determine the feasibility of conducting a distantly delivered-weight loss and exercise intervention for patients who have been treated for breast cancer at three cancer centers, and to evaluate the efficacy of an Internet-based behavioral weight loss and exercise intervention delivered to overweight/obese breast cancer survivors in three New England locations. Participants will be recruited from three New England Cancer Centers - the Vermont Cancer Center, Norris Cotton Cancer Center at Dartmouth University and the University of Massachusetts Cancer Center. Participants from each center will undergo baseline assessments that include diet assessment, body measurements (height, weight, etc), a physical activity assessment and be asked to complete a series of questionnaires. Patients that meet the minimum requirements will be enrolled on the study. They will participate in weekly on-line \"chats\" about behavioral and diet modifications led by a qualified facilitator. Participants will also engage in increasing amounts of aerobic activity (typically walking) throughout the course of the intervention. The intervention lasts 6 months. At the end of those 6 months, participants will have the same assessments that were collected at baseline.

These two separate cohorts are included in one single protocol to enable patient data from these two groups to be entered into a common database, as the current prognostic classifications determining treatment may evolve further with subsequent more detailed molecular analysis of the tumours. 1. LOW RISK STUDY The Low Risk Study is proposed in order to: - minimise the amount of treatment (chemotherapy and surgery) for all appropriate low risk patients, who in previous studies have been shown to have an excellent long-term outcome (as in the SIOPEN 99.1-2 infant neuroblastoma studies where the overall survival was greater than 97%(H. Rubie, JCO). - improve the EFS and maintain the OS (overall survival) in L2 and Ms patients with a SCA(Segmental Cromosomal Aberration) genomic profile tumour (presence of any segmental chromosomal change (SCA)) by electively treating these patients with chemotherapy despite the absence of symptoms. 2) INTERMEDIATE RISK STUDY The Intermediate Risk Study is proposed in order to: - reduce the amount of chemotherapy for differentiating histology INRG (International Neuroblastoma Risk Group) stage L2 NB and ganglioneuroblastoma nodular patients who in previous SIOPEN study have been shown to have an excellent long-term outcome; - increase the amount of treatment (radiotherapy and 13-cis-RA (13-cis-Retinoic Acid) for poorly differentiated or undifferentiated histology INRG stage L2 NB or ganglioneuroblastoma nodular patients in order to improve the EFS registered in the previous SIOPEN study; - improve the EFS (Event Free Survival) of MYCN (V-Myc myelocytomatosis viral related oncogene, NB derived ,avian )amplified INSS (International NB Staging System) stage 1 NB patients with the introduction of adjuvant treatment; - maintain the very good results obtained in previous SIOPEN study for INRG stage M infants with a moderate treatment.

       "  'An estimated 6.6 million parents who smoke visit pediatric emergency departments (PED) annually. Up to 50% of these parental smokers are from low-income, racially/ethnically diverse households in which a variety of tobacco-related disparities (TRD) exist for both the parents and their children. The PED is an ideal setting in which to address these disparities, which include differences in tobacco use, pediatric second hand smoke exposure (SHSe), quit rates, access to cessation resources, and morbidity such as cancer. The team has conducted the only two small-scale randomized control trials (RCTs) investigating the efficacy of providing smoking cessation counseling to parents in the PED setting. This previous research indicates that parental smokers who visit the PED are aware of the pediatric effects of SHSe, motivated to quit, eager to receive cessation counseling in this setting, and show trends towards quitting. Parents with children who have a SHSe-related illness will have higher prolonged abstinence and point prevalence cessation rates, higher motivation to quit, greater number of quit attempts, and lower child SHSe compared to those parents who have a child with a non-SHSe-related illness at baseline.',\n",
       "  'The long-range goal of my research is to test PED-based cessation interventions that are readily translated into practice in large, multi-center trials. However, before this can occur, preliminary data are needed, including analyses of: (1) the types of cessation intervention components that low-income parental smokers regard as essential to their cessation success; (2) perceived organizational barriers to the sustainability of the intervention after the study period ends which will impede translation into practice; (3) factors associated with parental cessation outcomes such as the presence of an acute SHSe-related chief complaint in the child; and (4) the effect size of the intervention. This data will be used to develop a parental cessation intervention that is tailored to low-income parents who are likely to quit. Data from the proposed project will be used in a RO1 application to test the efficacy of this cessation intervention in a large, multi-center randomized trial. The proposed developmental study will be conducted in three phases. During Phase I, the investigators will conduct focused interviews of PED nurses, physicians, and hospital administrators to explore barriers to intervention sustainability that will assist in future intervention planning. During Phase II, The investigators will conduct a pilot prospective trial to examine the effectiveness of this screening, brief intervention, and assisted referral to treatment (SBIRT) intervention on parental smoking cessation. Equal numbers of parental smokers who bring their child to the PED for either a SHSe-related illness or non SHSe-related illness will be given a brief intervention using an adapted form of the Clinical Practice Guidelines: Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence. Intervention components may include brief cessation counseling using an \"Advise, Assess, and Assist\" approach; information on SHSe in children; direct connection to the Quitline (QL) in the ED; and/or free administration of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). The Health Belief Model will be used to explore whether factors unique to this setting (e.g., child\\'s acute illness) moderate the effect of the intervention on cessation outcomes. Outcomes will be assessed following the intervention via phone, email, or text messaging, based on parental preference. In Phase III we will explore the feasibility of a pilot study to collect, send, analyze, and store child saliva samples in twenty five children whose parents consent to the study. The same PED-based SBIRT cessation intervention will be given to these parental smokers as in Specific Aim 2, however, only English-speaking parents and parents of children who are 0-5 years of age who present to the PED with SHSe-related illnesses will be asked if they agree to have their child participate in this baseline and then 1-month after baseline, saliva sample collection. These saliva samples will be analyzed to assess child cotinine levels at baseline and again at 1 month after the SBIRT cessation intervention. Leftover saliva will be stored and frozen indefinitely for possible future research, if parents consent.',\n",

However, its efficacy and resistance profile in the Asian population, which constitute the majority of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients, is unknown. Compared to other nucleoside analogues, TDF has been associated with relatively high rates of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seroclearance. It would be interested to see if this could be reproduced. The investigators plan to report the serologic and virologic results of our 140 nucleoside analogue-experienced patients who were commenced on TDF.',\n",
       "  'Recent multi-center trials have shown tenofovir disoprovil fumarate (TDF) demonstrating potent antiviral efficacy in both nucleoside-naive and -experienced chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients. At present, there has been no identifiable amino acid substitutions associated with resistance to TDF. Since TDF and adefovir (ADV), another licensed drug for CHB, belong to same molecular group, acyclic phosphonate, there had been various studies investigating the efficacy of TDF in ADV-resistant patients. The efficacy of tenofovir in this group of patients is conflicting. While several studies have shown TDF achieving similar viral suppression when compared to CHB patients without ADV-resistance , another study found that patients with the signature ADV mutations of rtA181V/T and /or rtN236T responded suboptimally to TDF. For all published studies, the number of patients with documented genotypic resistance to adefovir is actually small (n = 17-40), and therefore, further studies in this area are required. Another interesting point to note was the relatively high rate of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seroclearance found in patients taking TDF. The cumulative rate of HBsAg seroclearance up in hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive was 10% after 4 years . However, the same study did not find any HBeAg-negative patients achieving HBsAg seroclearance. In addition, studies on TDF were mainly performed in Caucasian patients, the majority being genotypes A and D. A preliminary study performed in Asian patients, predominantly genotypes B and C, did not discover any cases of HBsAg seroclearance . Given the majority of the CHB population is found in Asia, further studies are needed to clarify if HBsAg seroclearance by nucleoside / nucleotide analogues is potentially achievable using TDF.',\n",

       "  'Gemcitabine in Combination With the Oral Irreversible ErbB Inhibitor Afatinib Versus Gemcitabine Alone in Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer: an Explorative Randomized Phase II Trial',\n",
       "  \"Single-agent gemcitabine is currently still regarded as one international standard of care for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer (Burris 1997 [4]). The oral EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib received EMEA-approval for the treatment of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer in January 2007. In the pivotal phase III trial, the combination of gemcitabine plus erlotinib was associated with a statistically significant prolongation of OS (compared to single-agent gemcitabine), however, the absolute survival benefit was - for the overall study population - clinically moderate (median OS: 6.24 vs 5.91 months, 1-year OS rate: 23% vs 17%; HR = 0.82, p=0.038) (Moore 2007 [19]). The recently presented FOLFIRINOX regimen shows enhanced activity in metastatic pancreatic cancer patients. This regimen is, however, limited to patients with good performance status (ECOG 0-1), no major comorbidity, age <75 years, and bilirubin <1.5 ULN (Conroy 2011 [6]). The majority of pancreatic cancer patients will therefore not be treated with this regimen. Accordingly, novel treatment concepts are urgently needed in pancreatic cancer and pre-clinical data indicate an important role of the EGFR1/erbB2 receptor signalling in the pathogenesis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (Yeh 2007 [24]). A recent publication (Larbouret 2010 [16]) indicates that the combination of cetuximab and trastuzumab induced superior antitumour activity in human pancreatic carcinoma xenografts compared to gemcitabine alone (see also Larbouret 2007 [15]). Furthermore, synergistic antitumour activity was observed when monoclonal antibodies directed against the EGFR1 and erbB2 were combined (Ben-Kasus 2009 [3]). Based on these data, there is a good rationale to further investigate the combined inhibition of the erbB family in pancreatic cancer patients. Afatinib (BIBW 2992) is a novel irreversible EGFR1- and HER2 and HER4 inhibitor that is applied orally. The purpose of the present trial is to investigate the erbB family inhibition by afatinib in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. In the planned trial, afatinib will be applied at the dose (40 mg/day) that was chosen for the randomised phase III trial (LUX 5 study) that investigates afatinib plus weekly paclitaxel (80mg/m2). Presently there is also a phase I study ongoing that investigates the combination of afatinib with gemcitabine (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01251653 U10-2249-02 ). Possibly the data will be available once the study is ready to start. Otherwise a modification of the regimen will be planned once the respective data will be available. In this trial, we integrate a translational project which may allow the identification of patients that primarily benefit from this novel treatment approach. The availability of tumour tissue- and blood samples from each patient is therefore an important inclusion criterion. A 2:1 randomisation is chosen favouring the experimental arm since a large body of data is available on gemcitabine alone and since sufficient efficacy and toxicity data shall be gained in the experimental arm. In addition, the patients' motivation to take part in the trial will be greatly enhanced by a greater chance to receive the experimental agent.\",\n",

       "  'Data collected from this study will provide information on the breast milk zinc concentration, maternal and infant zinc status, and transfer of zinc from mothers breast milk to infants during first six months of life.',\n",
       "  'The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has reviewed published literature to collect information for its Coordinated Research Project (CRP) on Zinc Nutrition During Early Life , and observed that there is limited information on: 1) the concentration of zinc in breast milk of mothers in lower income countries at different times post-partum; 2) the total amount of zinc transferred from mothers to infants at different ages in these settings, and 3) zinc transfer from mother to infant born with appropriate-for-gestational-age (AGA) and small-for-gestational-age (SGA). Therefore, IAEA has planned to assist local scientists to collect such information from selected countries. The International Zinc Nutrition Consultative Group (IZiNCG) has identified Bangladesh as a country with high risk of zinc deficiency (IZiNCG, 2004), where the rate of SGA infants is >30% - one of the highest in the world (de Onis, 1998). Thus, Bangladesh is an appropriate candidate country to participate in this CRP. This study will enroll 50 healthy, full-term, newborn infants (>37 weeks gestational age by ultrasound) and their mothers if they plan to breast-feed exclusively for at least 4 months and also to continue breast feeding for at least 12 months. The infants will be examined, weighed and measured within 48 hours of birth, half of whom will be AGA (BW>2800g) and the other half SGA (BW<2500g). Infants with any acute or chronic illnesses, or congenital anomalies will not be eligible. Any mother with toxaemia, pregnancy-induced hypertension, multiple pregnancies, previously diagnosed as positive for HIV/hepatitis B infections, or habituated to smoking or alcohol consumption will also be excluded. The participants will be recruited from Nandipara, Dhaka, an urban community where the ICDDRB has ongoing clinical study facilities. Each of the eligible mother-infant pairs will be studied in 3 separate rounds, at 4, 12 and 24 weeks post-partum. In each round, two-week studies of breast milk transfer from the mother to the infant will be carried out, using the deuterium \"dose-to-the-mother\" technique. In each round, the women will be requested to attend the Dhaka Hospital of ICDDR, B on day 0, for collection of baseline saliva samples from mother-infant pairs and administration of deuterium to the mothers. Study health workers will make home visits on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 13, and 14 and collect saliva samples from the infants and their mothers on days 1, 2, 13 and 14, of each round. ~2 ml of saliva will be collected for each sample from both the mother and the infant. On days 0 and 4 of each round, 5-10 ml of manually-expressed breast milk will be collected for determining their zinc concentration. The total zinc transfer from mother to infant will be calculated as the product of the mean daily milk volume, as determined from the deuterium studies, and the mean milk zinc concentration on the days of milk collection. On the first day of each of the rounds at 4, 12 and 24 week post-partum 2.0 ml of venous blood will be collected from both the mothers and infants for serum zinc assay. Body weight, length and head circumference of infants, and body weight and height of mothers will be measured on day 0 at 4, 12 and 24 week post-partum. Breast milk volume and zinc concentration, and total zinc transfer from mothers to infants will be the major outcome variables, which will be examined for conformance to the normal distribution and transformed if required. Means of the major outcome variables will be compared for AGA and SGA infants for each time points, using repeated measures ANOVA. Repeated measures analysis of covariance will be used to assess if these relationships change with age. Analyses will be done with SAS Release 9 and SPSS version 10.',\n",

       "  'Chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) and pneumonia are leading causes of death in United States and worldwide. COPD, which is also a significant source of disability, is increasing in prevalence. Approximately 14 million adults have asthma, which leads to approximately 12 million missed work days per year in the United States. In adults, COPD and asthma often coexist. Treatment options for COPD are limited, and prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is high. COPD lung disease (COPD, asthma, airflow obstruction), and most COPD additional co-morbidities responsible for COPD progression (e.g., respiratory infections/pneumonia, muscle weakness, cardiac failure) may benefit from vitamin D supplementation therapy, but this requires rigorous testing. Marine omega-3 fatty acids work through different pathways from vitamin D to affect inflammation. Observational studies and clinical trials suggest that consumption of fish and/or fish oil may protect against COPD, asthma or pneumonia, but the data are not consistent. Thus, there is a compelling need for a clinical trial to evaluate the potential benefits or risks of vitamin D and fish oil supplementation on COPD and asthma exacerbations, airflow obstruction and decline of lung function, and risk of pneumonia. The primary outcomes of interest in Lung VITAL are COPD/asthma exacerbations and dyspnea (shortness of breath); airflow obstruction and decline of pulmonary function; and pneumonia. Asthma control is a secondary outcome; and new-onset COPD and asthma are tertiary outcomes. Lung VITAL will be conducted among all 20,000 participants in VITAL (NCT 01169259).

Specifically this proposal is an observational study of transfusion and brain tissue saturation in sTBI patients. The results will illustrate to what degree brain tissue oxygenation is critically dependent on the degree of anemia in sTBI and help in the decision of whether transfusion might be helpful.',\n",
       "  'While there are studies that have invasively monitored cerebral saturation and brain tissue oxygen in severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) patients, there are none using non-invasive cerebral saturation monitoring in TBI patients undergoing packed red blood cell (pRBC) transfusion. To date, all published studies have involved invasive monitoring with their concomitant potential side effects. Insertion of invasive probes and monitors has several risks and side effects including bleeding, local trauma and brain damage, and infection. Furthermore, they have limited utility as information is restricted to the region of the brain surrounding the probe, as opposed to a more global picture. We therefore propose an observational study using non-invasive near infrared spectroscopy to monitor brain tissue oxygen during the transfusion of packed red blood cells. Primary Hypothesis: • Improved oxygen delivery causes improved brain tissue oxygen saturation. Testable Hypothesis: • The transfusion of packed red blood cells resulting in a change in the hemoglobin in the 70- 100g/L range, will be associated with an increase in cerebral tissue oxygen saturation measured by near infrared spectroscopy in severe traumatic brain injured patients. Primary Aims: • Evaluate the applicability of a 4 wavelength near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to monitor the cerebral oximetry in traumatic brain injury patients. Observe the trend of cerebral tissue oxygenation saturations (StO2) before, during and after a blood transfusion in TBI patients. Secondary Hypothesis: - We hypothesize that as pRBCs are transfused there will be a plateau (i.e. hemoglobin threshold) beyond which no increase in cerebral tissue oxygenation will occur. - There will be lag time between the increase in systemic hemoglobin and the improvement of cerebral tissue oxygenation. Secondary Aims: - To correlate the systemic hemoglobin level with cerebral tissue oxygenation saturation as pRBCs are transfused. - Correlation of non-invasive cerebral tissue oxygenation saturation measurements with invasive brain tissue oxygen tension (if available).',\n",

A cohort study conducted in Australia and New Zealand in 2010 revealed a high prevalence of deep sedation within the first 48 hours of mechanical ventilation which was independently linked to prolonged ventilation, hospital and 180 days mortality. Clinical practice is moving towards the use of lighter levels of sedation. Recent RCTs in Europe (JAMA 2012) and previous RCTs (JAMA 2009) supports growing evidence that dexmedetomidine facilitates rousable sedation, shortens ventilation time and attenuates delirium when compared to midazolam and propofol. The investigators confirmed in a pilot study the feasibility, efficacy and safety of a process of care known as Early Goal Directed Sedation (EGDS) that delivers: 1. Early randomization after intubation or arrival in the ICU (intubated). 2. Early Adequate analgesia after randomization. 3. Goal directed sedation titrated to achieve light sedation. 4. Dexmedetomidine based algorithm as the primary sedative agent with avoidance of benzodiazepines. The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of Early Goal Directed Sedation when compared to standard care sedation in critically ill patients.

       "  \"The purpose of this research study is to identify factors and genes (the nucleic acid material that determines the makeup of the human body) that may be associated with how patients respond to pain medication, like morphine, which are called opioids. Though these pain medicines are used everyday, some patients have bad reactions from their use, like breathing problems, sedation, etc. It is not possible to completely predict which pain medicine is 'right' for a child. The investigators want to study factors that may be associated with pain sensitivity, pain medicine requirements after surgery and their side-effects. The investigators expect that the information obtained in this research study will help us to develop effective, safer, and tailored treatment options in the future.\",\n",
       "  \"Opioids are the mainstay for treatment of postoperative pain in children. Experience dictates that opioids have narrow therapeutic indices and large inter-patient variability in response. This leads to serious side effects like respiratory depression in up to 50% of children undergoing invasive surgery, which can be fatal. Moreover, up to two-thirds of the inter-individual variability in response to opioids results from genetic variations both from variability in pain perception as well as response to the pain medicine. Much of the inter-individual variability in response to opioids following surgical procedures can be explained by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a subset of the genes that encode proteins involved in pain perception, opioid transport/metabolism (pharmacokinetics) and opioid receptor signaling (pharmacodynamics). It is evident that there are particular children who are more susceptible to suffering side effects and having inadequate pain relief from opioids. Identifying genetic and non-genetic predictors for this susceptibility is vital for safe and effective analgesia in children. This is a critical knowledge gap in medical literature that significantly impacts pediatric pain management. The investigators' central hypothesis is that specific genetic polymorphisms in genes involved in pain perception, opioid transport and opioid receptor signaling pathways contribute significantly to pain sensitivity, opioid side-effects and analgesic efficacy in children. The choice and dosing of opioids has thus far been largely empirical, with a frequent need to switch opioids and alter doses due to inherent differences in individuals. By this study, the investigators hope to determine the 'right' doses of the 'right' opioids for optimized and safe postoperative analgesia in children. The investigators' long term goal is to develop more effective, safer and tailored pediatric opioid analgesia, by contributing to better understanding of the underlying genetic basis for variations in the sensitivity to pain, pain relief, and development of adverse effects from the extended use of postoperative intravenous opioids, in children.\",\n",

       "  'Patients experience pain after surgery mostly from their abdominal wounds, even when those wounds are small. Decreasing that pain has many benefits. It improves comfort, decreases stress response and might improve the outcome of the surgery. Local anesthesia (which is a numbing agent given directly at the site of pain via a needle) is given to decrease the pain that is felt after surgery and decrease the need for strong pain medications which can have negative side effects. One promising way to give local pain medication is called the \"transversus abdominis plane\" or TAP block. This method works by directly blocking the nerves in the abdomen that are the cause of the pain patients feel in their incision after surgery. This is done by injecting a numbing agent (Bupivacaine) into the area of their abdomen where their nerves are located that cause pain. In the case of nerves that carry sensation, bupivacaine blocks the pain sensation traveling in a particular nerve. Patients will be randomized (like a flip of a coin) to receive either a normal saline injection or the bupivacaine injection. The purpose of this study will be to prove the effectiveness of local anesthetic given via a TAP block in improving postoperative pain, decreasing the use of pain medications, decreasing postoperative nausea and vomiting and improve surgical outcomes such as hospital length of stay in laparoscopic colorectal surgery.',\n",
       "  'Using standard surgical procedures, the surgeon will proceed with the planned laparoscopic surgery. All procedures will be done by straight laparoscopic technique according to standard of care. At the completion of the procedure, and under laparoscopic control, patients will have a TAP block placed by the attending surgeon. The clinical research nurse involved in the research will prep the solution to be injected and the surgeon will be blinded as to whether the patient will be receiving normal saline or Marcaine in the TAP blocks. The block will be administered between the costal margin and iliac crest in the anterior axillary line. A Braun Stimuplex A insulated needle (80 mm 21 gauge) with 0.5 mL/kg solution (max of 30 ml) is passed through the skin, and then continued until two distinct \"pops\" are felt, which indicates the needle piercing each of the two fascial layers. The needle is then deemed to be in the inter-muscular plane between internal oblique and transversus abdominis muscles respectively, to target the spinal nerves in this plane. The laparoscope will be visualizing for the needle tip to ensure that it does not penetrate the peritoneum or inject pre-peritoneally. The local anesthetic is infiltrated in two separate injections into the same plane on each side. If a sub-peritoneal bleb is seen to be raised by the laparoscope, then the needle will be withdrawn slightly. Two thirds of the solution is injected, and the needle is withdrawn 5 mm and the remaining solution is injected. If injecting in the correct plane, then a smooth raised area of fluid, covered by transversus will be seen via the laparoscope. This procedure is repeated on the patients other side, to complete a bilateral block. Depending on their randomization, patients will receive one of the following solutions: Group A: Represents the control group and will receive 0.5 ml/kg of 0.9% normal saline for a maximum of 30 ml.

       "  'Brief Summary Cerebral Autoregulation is a well known physiological response to blood pressure changes to maintain the cerebral perfusion. The critically ill patients are submitted to different situations that can impair the cerebral autoregulation as sepsis, sedation drugs and mechanical ventilation. The delirium on ICU has been described as a bad prognosis factor, increasing the mortality and length of stay. The physiopathology of delirium has been related to cerebral perfusion. The delirium has been related to long term cognitive impairment. Material and Methods: This is a physiological prospective study that will be done in a 14 bed medical-surgical ICU. The investigators will enroll 100 ventilated patients, septic and non-septic. The investigators will measure cerebral autoregulation every 48-72 hours from admission on ICU. Neurological biomarkers (Neurological Specific Enolase, S100 beta and Vascular Endothelial Growing Factor) will be done at inclusion, 72 hours and 7 days. Clinical data, delirium presence, analytic data and ventilatory parameters will be registered every day. At hospital discharge, a psychologist will do a cognitive evaluation using specific tests. The cognitive evaluation will be repeated at 3, 6 and 12 months. Anticipate results: Some items like mechanical ventilation, sepsis and sedation can impair cerebral autoregulation. The impairment of cerebral autoregulation is related to delirium in ICU and long cognitive impairment.',\n",
       "  'Introduction: Cerebral Autoregulation (CA) is the physiological strategy used for the brain to maintain the cerebral blood flow constant during blood pressure (BP) changes. The evaluation of CA dynamic and static models has been described in the literature. The coefficient Sx and the Mx are one of the validated dynamic methods. These coefficients are obtained from the correlation between BP and Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA) velocity measured using Transcranial Doppler (TCD). Correlation values higher than 0.3 reflect an impairment of CA. The incidence of CA impairment in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is not well described. Neither, risk factors or clinical situations that precipitate CA impairment have been studied. Mechanical Ventilation (MV) is a common treatment in the ICU. The main difference is the positive pressure administrated to the lungs instead of the negative pressure in spontaneous breathing. The positive pressure applied in the alveoli causes a local and systemic inflammatory response. Lung injuries are well described due to MV. Some studies relate changes in the Intracranial Pressure (ICP) and Cerebral Perfusion Pressure (CPP) with the Positive End- Expiratory Pressure in neurological patients. Also changes in the MCA velocity have been described with MV. The studies speculate that the changes are related to the intrathoracic positive pressure. However, all studies are in patients with acute neurological pathology. In the ICU sedation drugs are often used to guarantee patient comfort in the MV. The BIS ® device is used for monitoring sedation level based on the electroencephalogram drawing. Recent studies analyse the influence of this drugs on CA in healthy volunteers. However, no studies have described the effects of long sedations like usually occurs in ICU. The incidence of delirium in the ICU has been described as 50%. In mechanically ventilated patients the incidence increases to 80%. Delirium is considered an independent factor of bad prognosis. It increases the days under mechanical ventilation, hospital length of stay, the dependence at discharge and the risk of death. Because of that, it has a high impact in health and in economic cost. However it is an underdiagnosed illness due to the absence of ICU protocols for the correct diagnosis. The scale Confusion Assessment Method for ICU (CAM - ICU) is the validated tool for the screening and it is used by the nurses and physicians. The long term cognitive impairment is well described in patients admitted in the ICU. A recent study followed-up the patients subjected to mechanical ventilator who had developed delirium. They use the Mini-mental State Examination Score and they found that at 3 month following-up 61% patients had severe cognitive impairment and 17% a moderate impairment. At 12 months the 36% of patients still had a severe impairment and the 35% a moderate impairment. The developing of delirium during the ICU admission is considered a risk factor for long term cognitive impairment. Sepsis has been also related with cognitive impairment. Iwashyna et al, published that patients with basal moderate cognitive impairment who survived a severe infection, had higher probability of getting worse compared to patients who were admitted for other reasons. Some biomarkers for neurological damage are well known. The S100B protein, present in the calcium canal of glial cells, and the Neurological Specific Enolase (NSE), an enzyme that participates in neurological glucolysis are increased in patients with Brain Trauma, cerebral ischemia or bleeding. In older patients with delirium the levels of S100B are also increased, but not the NSE levels. In critical patients the S100B and NSE have been used for delirium and cognitive impairment markers. However, the publications have been contradictories. Most of them find high levels of S100Bin septic and postoperative patients who developed delirium, but in some studies no significant differences have been seen. NSE has not relation with delirium in septic patients, however, after cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation both markers, S100B and NSE, are good predictors of delirium and cognitive impairment at 6 months. Vascular Endothelial Growing Factor (VEGF) takes part in the vascular and cerebral regeneration in the neurological system. It is considered a neuronal protector. Cerebral hypoxia stimulates the expression of VEGF for starting the vascular neogenesis. No studies related VEGF with delirium in the critical patient. Assuming that hypoxia and ischemia can develop delirium in the ICU, the VEGF levels may be augmented. Hypothesis: The critical patient under mechanical ventilation can have impaired CA due to situation as sepsis and multiorgan failure. The CA impairment can be related to sedation, pressors or some co-morbidity. Primary objective: 1. To determinate the CA impairment in critically ill patient. Secondary objectives: 1. To describe evolving patterns of CA in the critically ill patient. 2. To describe the influence of MV, sedation and sepsis on CA. 3. To analyze the relation between CA impairment and delirium in the ICU and long term cognitive impairment. 4. To determinate the long term cognitive status of patients who had CA impairment during the ICU admission. 5. To determinate the levels and kinetic evolution, and prognosis power of the biomarkers S100B, NSE and VEGF in critically ill patients. 6. To describe the influence of CA impairment on mortality. Material and methods: Study Field This is a physiological observational prospective study done in a University Hospital of 400 beds approximately. The study will take place in a medical-surgical ICU of 14 beds. Consecutive enrolment of patients admitted on Fundació Althaia ICU of Manresa, Spain. Methods: Cerebral autoregulation analysis The investigators will use TCD to determinate CA situation. A continuous monitoring of MCA velocity and simultaneous invasive arterial pressure will be done every 48-72 hours during admission and when the patient is under MV. The investigators will calculate the Mx and Sx coefficients, defined as Pearson correlation between the average of mean (Mx) and systolic (Sx) MCA velocity and average of the values of arterial pressure waveform every 3 minutes. The software used is DWL Compumedics Monitoring ® to measure MCA velocity and arterial pressure waveform every 1 millisecond. The monitoring test will take between 20 minutes and 1 hour time. The sedation depth will be continuous monitored using Bispectral Index System (BIS) of Covidien ®. Ramsay scale will be registered every 6 hours by nurses. Cognitive evaluation After the discharge from the hospital the cognitive situation will be evaluated using neuropsychological tests. A medical psychologist of Fundació Althaia Psychiatry Service will do the evaluation. The test grouping has been designed following the recommendation for medical population. Two or more of these tests under 1.5 SD general population standards will be considered as cognitive impairment. The test used includes psychometric tools for neuropsychological evaluation: - Attention and velocity of processing - Selective attention: Trail Making Test Part A; direct numbers (WMS-III). - Divide attention and velocity of processing: Trail Making Test Part B; Symbol test and numbers. - Memory: - Immediate verbal memory: direct numbers (WSM - III), learning: word list I (WMS- III). - Short term verbal memory (WMS - III) - Long term verbal memory (WMS - III) - Short term visual memory (WMSD - III) - Long term visual memory (WMS - III) - Language: - Verbal nomination for visual confrontation (Boston nomination test) - Verbal comprehension (Token test) - Visual-space and visual-construction function (WAIS - III) - Executive function: - Concept formation and cognitive flexibility (WSCT) - Memory of work: inverse numbers (WMS - III) - Verbal fluency. - Previous performance estimation: vocabulary (WAIS - III). Depressive and psychotic evaluation While the long term cognitive impairment evaluation, Depressive symptomatology will also be evaluated using the Beck Inventory. The psychotic evaluation will be carried out using the Brief Psychiatric Evaluation Scale. S100B, NSE and VEGF levels At inclusion time the levels of biomarkers S100B, NSE and VEGF will be determined. The investigators will repeat the samples at 72 hours and 7 days.',\n",

We have recently shown that dietary intake of two trimethylamines abundant in animal products, carnitine and the choline group of phosphatidylcholine (PC), are mechanistically linked to cardiovascular disease risk. We wish to further explore the metabolism of these nutrients in humans, and to test the hypothesis that the intestinal micro flora (gut flora) plays a critical role in generation of metabolites from dietary carnitine and choline/PC linked to cardiometabolic disease. We further hypothesize that the production of specific metabolites of carnitine and choline/PC are influenced by the composition of gut flora, and these may be altered by the preceding dietary patterns of the subjects. We therefore wish to test whether dietary supplementation with carnitine and/or choline alters the metabolism of carnitine and choline/PC in subjects. We also hypothesize that transient suppression or modulation of gut flora via short-term broad spectrum antibiotic therapy, or by reconstitution of micro flora composition via probiotic therapy, in healthy subjects, can alter the metabolism of carnitine and choline/PC. We will also examine the impact of low dose aspirin on these pathways by examining subjects before versus after taking aspirin.',\n",

Available treatment options for unresectable disease include the use of somatostatin analogs, which may relieve symptoms related to hormonal hypersecretion. The efficacy of cytotoxic chemotherapy in patients with metastatic carcinoid tumors is also limited. Combinations of either streptozocin and cyclophosphamide, or streptozocin and 5-fluorouracil, appear to be inactive, and both regimens are associated with substantial toxicity. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are implicated in deregulated/ autocrine proliferation and survival of solid and hematologic cancer cells.

       "  'Platelets are parts of your blood that stick together to help form a clot. The stickier your platelets are, the greater your chance of having a heart attack. A clot in the wrong place can lead to a heart attack or stroke. Ticagrelor (Brilinta) keeps platelets from sticking together and it helps people from having a heart attack. The American College of Cardiology has recommended a combination of aspirin and Brilinta as one of the best treatments for the prevention of heart attacks, and death in patients who have had a heart attack or coronary stents. However, it is unknown if Brilinta may improve its work to keep platelets from sticking together giving a loading dose in patients already treated with Brilinta. A loading dose is a one-time increased dose of the same drug. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate whether the platelets of patients treated with Brilinta become less sticky when Brilinta is re-loaded.',\n",
       "  'A higher degree of platelet inhibition remains the goal of peri-interventional and long-term anti-thrombotic therapy in patients with coronary artery disease. Previous observations have shown that in patients on clopidogrel therapy undergoing percutanoues coronary intervention who get re-loaded with clopidogrel obtain enhanced platelet inhibition. Ticagrelor represents a new class of nonthienopyridine platelet inhibitors designed to address the limitations of current oral antiplatelet therapy, which has been recently approved for clinical use. However, to date it is unknown if greater inhibition of platelet aggregation can be achieved by adding a ticagrelor loading dose in patients already on maintenance ticagrelor therapy (90 mg twice daily). In addition, how to manage patients undergoing coronary interventions already on chronic ticagrelor therapy with regards to ticagrelor loading is an emerging clinical question which has yet to be explored. Therefore, understanding the pharmacodynamic implications of a ticagrelor re-load strategy in patients on already on chronic ticagrelor therapy is warranted. The scope of the present study is to evaluate the impact of ticagrelor re-load in patients on chronic ticagrelor therapy. A total of 60 patients will be randomized into one of the following two arms of treatment: 1) 90 mg of ticagrelor; 2) 180 mg of ticagrelor. Pharmacodynamic assessments will be performed at baseline, 1-hour and 4-hour after dosing administration.

       "  'Pancreaticojejunostomy is the key procedure of pancreaticoduodenectomy. The aim of our study is to investigate a new pancreaticojejunal (PJ) anastomosis procedure named \"nonstented stump-closed pancreaticojejunostomy\" in pancreatoduodenectomy, which could provide a feasible option to pancreatic surgeons for patients with pancreaticoduodenectomy.',\n",
       "  'Pancreaticoduodenectomy is a standard surgical approach for resectable pancreatic tumors and periampullary tumors. It is considered a safe procedure resulting from the continuous improvement in surgical techniques over the years. Although postoperative mortality has obviously decreased, pancreatic fistula is still a major challenge in pancreatic surgery and remains the major cause of postoperative morbidity and mortality after pancreaticoduodenectomy(PD), ranging from 5% to 30%. Many risks factors have been shown to cause pancreatic fistula(PF) after the operation, including advanced age, prolonged operation time, intraoperative hemorrhage, BMI, soft pancreas, size of the main pancreatic duct and texture of the remnant pancreas. Among them, soft pancreatic texture without a dilated main pancreatic duct is regarded as the most important risk factor in predicting pancreatic fistula. The serious consequences of pancreatic fistula result from the pancreatic juice becoming activated by the bile and intestinal fluid, which will eventually corrupt the PJ anastomosis and the surrounding normal tissues. The corrosion of the vasculature will lead to lethal hemorrhage, which is the main cause of mortality after pancreaticoduodenectomy. Furthermore, pancreatin, together with the bacteria in the alimentary tract, will lead to intra-abdominal infection and abscess. To reduce the pancreatic fistula rate, several techniques have been described as alternatives to the conventional PJ anastomosis. Duct-to-mucosa sutures, binding pancreaticojejunostomy and end-to-side invaginated fashion are widely used in the current clinical setting. Some non-randomized studies showed that the duct-to-mucosa method was a relatively safe approach. However, the prospective clinical study found that in comparison with the conventional end-to-side anastomosis, duct-to-mucosa did not obviously decrease the incidence of pancreatic fistula as well as other operative complications. The Peng\\'s binding anastomosis technique might be relatively simple to operate and have shorter operative time, but as the raw pancreatic surface is exposed to the jejunal lumen directly after the reconstruction, the activated pancreatic juice might lead to hemorrhage through vascular corrosion. Moreover, a wide or large pancreatic stump will not fit the size of the jejunal lumen, which could lead to anastomosis ischemia and leakage. The duct-to-mucosa method is not affected by the size of pancreatic remnant and the jejunal lumen. The seromuscular layer of the jejunum covers the pancreatic stump completely and will lower the incidence of postoperative hemorrhage. It was proved to be superior to invagination anastomosis in terms of anastomotic patency and function. Unfortunately, in the cases of small main pancreatic duct or normal soft pancreas, the duct-to-mucosa approach is difficult to operate and takes more surgery time, while simultaneously increasing the incidence of postoperative pancreatic fistula(POPF). Therefore, it is difficult to find a single superior strategy that applies to every case. Selecting an optimal pancreaticojejunal anastomotic method should be based on the different textures of pancreas and the various sizes of the main pancreatic duct. The postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF), which determines postoperative mortality, length of hospital stay， is dependent of its definition, and is reported in up to 16% of patients. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the new anastomosis called \"nonstented stump-closed\" pancreaticojejunostomy can reduce the POPF rate and downgrade compared with the common accepted duct-to-mucosa pancreaticojejunostomy after pancreaticoduodenectomy. This single-centre, open, randomized controlled trail is conducted following International Study Group on Pancreatic Fistula (ISGPF) criteria for pancreatic fistula (PF). The primary endpoint is the POPF rate, and others include overall postoperative complication rate and their severity reoperation rate and hospital stay. Objectives: Through the comparison with classic pancreatic duct-to-mucosa anastomosis, to evaluate whether \"nonstented stump closed\" pancreaticojejunal anastomosis can reduce the pancreatic fistula and other complications incidence; to evaluated the safety and maneuverability. Patients and methods :all patients diagnosed with periampullar occupations which should be resected through pancreaticoduodenectomy will be evaluated before surgery, including CT,Magnetic Resonance(MR), Ultrasound B ,blood biochemical checks and cardiac and thoracical evaluations. Before the surgery, the patients are divided into two groups by randomization. After the pancreaticoduodenectomy, the randomization number decided the procedure of the pancreaticojejunostomy. Staging investigations will be standard and will include: pancreatic enhanced CT; magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography(MRCP); PET-CT if necessary; Randomization: Block randomization will be done using a computer generated sheet. Randomization will be performed 1 day before the operation. All surgeries will be performed under general anesthesia with epidural analgesia. The surgery will be either performed by or under the direct supervision of pancreatic surgeons with experience in pancreaticojejunostomy surgery. Operative time, blood loss, blood product replacement and all intraoperative details will be recorded in the proforma. Patients will be shifted postoperatively to the anesthesia care unit (PCU) for observation and subsequently to the recovery or high dependency ward once stabilized. Postoperative details including period of postoperative pancreatic fistula,biliary leakage,postoperative haemorrhage,postoperative pancreatitis , hospital stay and other complications will be recorded. Postoperative mortality will be defined as 30-day mortality plus death before discharge after surgery. Data management: All collected data will be entered into a statistical software package for subsequent analysis Main research variables: Primary Outcome : The primary endpoint will be the postoperative pancreatic fistula(POPF) rate.

       "  'This study protocol is designed to investigate the benefit of a well-tolerated, FDA approved biological product that has been extensively used in a different patient population. For more than 20 years, α1proteinase inhibitor (α1PI or α1antitrypsin) therapy has been the standard treatment for people with insufficient α1PI blood levels. This disorder, also known as α1antitrypsin deficiency, was previously thought to be caused only as an inherited trait due to the gene PIzz. Recent evidence shows that it can also be an acquired disease. Specifically, individuals with HIV-1 disease have been found to have severely low α1PI blood levels (Bristow et al., 2001; Bristow et al., 2010; Bristow et al., 2012). Many people with the inherited version of α1PI deficiency eventually develop emphysema, and among individuals with HIV-1 disease, 90% have acquired α1PI deficiency. Whether they go on to develop emphysema is still unresolved. HIV-1 infected individuals are the first patient population identified so far in which severe α1PI deficiency is acquired through infection rather than being inherited. It was found that a decrease in α1PI blood levels is directly correlated to a decrease in CD4 lymphocytes (Bristow et al., 2001; Bristow et al., 2012): In a pilot study to determine whether α1PI therapy might benefit the CD4 counts in HIV-1 infected patients (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01370018), HIV-1 patients with infection-related α1PI deficiency received weekly α1PI therapy (120mg/kg) for a period of 8 weeks and results were compared with those of patients having the inherited version of α1PI deficiency who were simultaneously receiving weekly α1PI therapy (60mg/kg). None of the patients in the study had ever previously received α1PI therapy. It was found that CD4 cells rose to normal levels following 2 weeks of intravenous α1PI therapy with no adverse effects observed in the HIV-1 patients (n=3) or the control group of HIV-1 uninfected, α1PI deficiency patients (n=2). The new crop of CD4 cells were functional, capable of fighting infection, and appeared to be generated from bone marrow-derived stem cells (Bristow et al., 2010). As a bonus, it was found in the HIV-1 patients that LDL levels (bad cholesterol) decreased and HDL levels (good cholesterol) increased {Bristow et al., in review). The information gained from the initial pilot study will be incorporated into this study design to further characterize the mechanism of lymphocyte renewal and to increase the number of patients observed. Only minor modifications to the pilot protocol are proposed including the sample size, addition of volunteers not receiving therapy, and a double-blind design: Ten (10) HIV-1 infected patients will be dosed with PROLASTIN®-C (Grifols Therapeutics Inc.), five (5) will be dosed with placebo, and five (5) uninfected volunteers not receiving therapy will be monitored. It has been observed that CD4 counts and cholesterol levels are correlated and that there is cyclic variation in individuals with and without HIV. To examine whether there are differences due to HIV infection in cyclic variation of CD4 counts, cholesterol levels, and other values monitored during this study, five (5) volunteers, who do not have HIV, will be included in the study for blood collection only. In a previous study, we determined that in individuals with abnormally low active α1PI levels, CD4 counts exhibit sinusoidal cycling with 23 day periodicity. Wave form appearance of CD4 cells with a peak every 23 days is a pattern that is indicative of adult thymopoiesis. We showed that in response to α1PI therapy, HIV infected and uninfected individuals exhibited an increased CD4 counts axis of oscillation, but no change in periodicity. In contrast, one uninfected individual who was not receiving therapy, exhibited no change in the axis of oscillation, but periodicity was 27 days. Human adult thymopoiesis is not well characterized, and based on these results, we have two hypotheses. One hypothesis is that in response to α1PI therapy, thymopoiesis will increase, manifested by an increased axis of oscillation and increased numbers of recent thymic emigrants. In the proposed study, we will perform weekly TREC analysis which measures recent thymic emigrants and is definitive for thymopoiesis. We will test whether the changes in TREC numbers corresponds with changes in the CD4 counts axis of oscillation in HIV infected individuals receiving α1PI therapy as compared with HIV infected individuals with abnormally low active α1PI levels not on α1PI therapy, and HIV uninfected individuals with normal active α1PI levels not on α1PI therapy. The second hypothesis is that in individuals with abnormally low active α1PI levels, the periodicity of CD4 counts is shorter than in individuals with normal active α1PI levels. Although we will measure periodicity in only 5 individuals with normal active α1PI levels and 15 with abnormal active α1PI levels, this will allow us to determine whether active α1PI is a linear determinate of periodicity or whether there are other variables that regulate periodicity. In an 8-week study, only 2 periods can be observed. Thus, following an 8-week regimen of therapy, one study subject may be asked to continue for a second 8-week regimen of therapy to allow the observation of 5 periods. In addition to these two primary hypotheses regarding CD4 counts, we have found that HDL and LDL levels are linearly dependent on the balance of active and inactive α1PI levels (manuscript in review). This phenomenon is due the transport of HDL and LDL by CD4 cells. We found that in HIV infected individuals with abnormally low active α1PI and abnormally high inactive α1PI, HDL and LDL increased or decreased differently from individuals with normal active α1PI. Based on these results, our hypothesis is that in HIV infected individuals with abnormally low active α1PI receiving α1PI therapy, LDL levels will decrease and HDL levels will increase as active α1PI levels increase in contrast to HIV uninfected individuals with normal active α1PI levels not on therapy and in contrast to HIV infected individuals with abnormally low active α1PI levels not on therapy. Prolastin-C treatment will be given weekly for eight (8) to sixteen (16) weeks by intravenous infusion. Blood will be collected immediately prior to each infusion. As in the previous study, complete blood count, lymphocyte phenotype, extended lymphocyte phenotype, lymphocyte function; HIV-1 viral load, lipid levels, blood chemistry, and markers of inflammation will be measured. The present study will also include measurements for HIV-1 tropism and markers for recent thymic emigrants.',\n",

       "  'Major depression (or MDD) in adolescents is a major public health problem. MDD affects approximately 15% of adolescents; it is associated with impairment in social, family, and academic functioning, and it is a major risk factor for suicide - a leading cause of death in adolescents . Unfortunately, there is a paucity of treatment options for this age group. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the only class of medications approved for treating MDD in adolescents, but rates of remission following treatment with SSRIs are only 30 to 45 percent. Cognitive behavior therapy is associated with similar remission rates and access is limited. Most adolescents will require more than one therapeutic intervention in order to achieve full symptom control. Collectively, there is overwhelming evidence that additional treatment options are urgently needed to improve outcomes for teens with MDD. One novel treatment for adolescent MDD is repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Studies in children have been limited (a total of 23 cases). This is surprising given the evidence suggesting younger adult subjects with MDD respond better to rTMS (56% response rate) than older subjects. This limited experience with rTMS for adolescent MDD represents a substantial gap in the knowledge, recently recognized in publications calling for further study of rTMS in adolescent depression. Most importantly, the mechanism of action of rTMS in adolescent MDD is not well understood. The objective of this application is to develop an understanding of the brain alterations associated with the positive clinical changes that occur with rTMS in adolescent MDD. Such knowledge will provide the basis for pursuing rTMS for adolescent MDD as a rational therapeutic technique. Specific Aim: To compare the effect of rTMS on DLPFC glutamate concentration in adolescent MDD. The investigators hypothesize an increase (normalization to controls) in DLPFC glutamate after three weeks of rTMS. Furthermore, the change in glutamate concentration will correlate with a change in MDD symptoms.',\n",
       "  \"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to identify neuroimaging, physiological, and clinical predictors of response, remission, and recovery to repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in youth with treatment resistant major depressive disorder. BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a major public health problem in adolescents. Unfortunately, there are no effectively targeted treatment options for this age group. Current remedies are limited in their effectiveness in youth with response and remission rates no greater than 60 to 30% respectively and treatment effects are not sustained throughout the life cycle. Further, ongoing controversies persist regarding the safety of antidepressants in youth. Current interventions were developed to solely target the symptoms of rather than the underlying neurobiology. Most importantly, there is no way to accurately predict an individual patient's response to interventions. Consequently, there is a critical need for optimally targeted interventions that directly address the relevant pathophysiology of depression. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is effective in adults with depression. rTMS is twice as likely to result in response (relative risk or RR: 2.35 [95% confidence interval or CI: 1.70-3.25]) and remission (RR: 2.24 [95% CI: 1.53-3.27] than a sham procedure Evidence in youth is also encouraging, with a 66% response rate in our pilot data (see Summary of Progress). The DLPFC plays a critical role in emotional regulation, directly connecting it to depressive symptomology. Our lab and others have clearly implicated structural and functional deficits in the DLPFC in youth with MDD. What is not known is what biomarkers best predict response, remission, and recovery with rTMS in youth with treatment resistant MDD. As response is not universal, this is a significant gap in our knowledge. Our basic model is that rTMS increases expression of BDNF, up-regulates activity of endocannabinoids, increases glutamate concentrations, and increases DLPFC activity - correcting the deficit seen in MDD. These biologic changes enhance executive control of mood state (see our pilot data in the Summary of Progress). These positive effects may be moderated by comorbidity (i.e., social phobia) and genotype (i.e., BDNF). How this model fits with response, remission, and recovery has yet to be fully tested and this information has the potential to be directly clinically meaningful. The central aim of the project is to evaluate predictors of rTMS response, remission, and recovery based on integrated neuroimaging, physiological, and clinical measures. While not a clinical trial per se (efficacy is not the primary outcome measure), we will use a non-randomized sham lead in to a single active (rTMS) arm study design as a framework for biomarker discovery. To accomplish this goal, we will pursue the following specific aims: The primary aim is to identify baseline neuroimaging, physiological, and clinical predictors of response to 3 weeks of rTMS treatment in adolescents with treatment resistant MDD.\",\n",

       "  \"Psychosis, principally involving schizophrenia, is a severe mental illness that commonly develops at a young age and often has a chronic course. The onset of Psychosis forces family members to bear a heavy burden of care. It has been documented over and over again that the mental well-being of the family is complicated. More than a dozen per cent of the family have the morbidity corresponding to be depressive and anxiety disorders. It is important to relieve their psychological stresses. The concept of the burden of care is so broad and complex that its simple definition is a challenging issue. It is usually defined as objective impacts on the household and subjective consequences, which contain physical, economic, emotional and psychological components. The psychological component involves the stigma against psychiatric disorders. The studies of intervention to the family having a psychotic member have been mostly conducted for the primary interest of reducing the rate of relapse and rehospitalization of the psychotic. Their rationale of the intervention is based on the roles of the family that develop the illness and cause a relapse (e.g., etiological relationship or expressed emotion). Although family psychoeducation has been established as an evidence-based practice especially for schizophrenic patients, few studies have primarily intended to reduce the burden of their family. Among various types of family psychoeducation, the group setting is considered as a better method in terms of the creation of social support networks, limited medical resources and cost-effectiveness. MacFarlane's multifamily psychoeducation is one of the representative models of a group setting, which is composed of joining sessions, an educational workshop and structured problem-solving group sessions. MacFarlane's model is based on the behavioral therapeutic approach that mainly aims at stopping a vicious cycle. The cycle of schizophrenia is peculiarly caused by expressed emotion, which is negative one expressed by the family that lead to a high relapse rate (e.g., hostility or criticism). In such psychological interventions, it has been emphasized to focus not only on the vicious cycle but also on strengths. The strengths are defined as the power that a person has originally for coping with difficulties. The intervention of mainly drawing out the strengths of the family might empower them to face difficulties voluntarily and lighten their psychological burden. However, to date, the effectiveness of family psychoeducation based on the strengths approach has not been confirmed. The onset of psychosis is generally at a young age. The first 2-5 years from the onset of psychosis is regarded as the critical period to improve the prognosis, so the intervention including more recent-onset psychotic patients might be of use. Additionally, the family of a young patient has been reported to have strong concerns about returning to school, going to work and getting married. With regard to a setting of the psychoeducational intervention, a homogeneous group one can make the program better fitted for their problems and heighten group cohesiveness.

       "  'This is randomized controlled study of neurocognitive outcomes in patients with five or more brain metastases treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), specifically the Gamma Knife (GK) system, or whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT). The goal of the study is to enroll 120 patients with at least five (≥5) newly-diagnosed brain metastases from non-melanoma, except melanoma patients with BRAF V600E B-Raf protein mutation, primary cancers with the largest intracranial tumor volume ≤10 cc, ≤15 cc total tumor volume, absence of leptomeningeal disease on MRI, and Karnofsky performance status (KPS) score ≥70 (unless due to intracranial disease), and KPS expected to improve to ≥70 with treatment. All study participants will undergo standard, pre-treatment clinical evaluations that include: complete clinical/neurologic exam, performance status assessment, systemic staging, and diagnostic MRI of the brain. The baseline neurocognitive function (NCF) will be assessed by a short (20-30 minute) online test battery that can be completed by patients at home. All study participants will be randomized to receive radiosurgical or whole-brain radiation treatment for their brain metastases. All patients will have treatment response assessments every 10-12 weeks consisting of a clinical/neurologic exam, performance status evaluation, disease re-staging (if indicated), and diagnostic MRI of the brain. If progressive disease is identified (radiographic progression of treated lesions or new brain lesions), the patients will be considered for \"salvage\" therapy which will primarily consist of SRS, WBRT, surgery±brachytherapy or best supportive care (e.g. steroids only). The preferred salvage therapy will be SRS provided that the re-treatment criteria are met. The NCF follow-up will start 2 weeks after completion of the initial SRS treatment and will repeat at 2-week intervals, irrespective of any salvage therapy that may be indicated. All study participants will be followed until death or withdrawal from the study. The primary aim of this study is to compare the change in neurocognitive outcome between baseline and 6 months for surviving patients in upfront WBRT versus SRS treatment groups. The primary study endpoint is neurocognitive function as measured by a significant change in online neurocognitive function (oNCF) z-score from baseline to 6 months. The outcomes will be compared after initial treatment and then repeatedly in follow-up, and will include the impact of salvage SRS treatments. This approach will allow us to assess the relative impact on neurocognitive outcomes of repeat SRS treatments to sites of new brain metastases. Since SRS and WBRT are two very different forms of treatment (single high-dose treatment vs. multiple low-dose treatments) with markedly different target volumes, it is expected that local control rates will also be markedly different. This, in turn, will impact salvage therapies and associated costs. This study will evaluate local control rates and overall intracranial disease control at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months as a function of initial treatment cohort (SRS vs. WBRT). We also expect significant differences between the treatment groups in patient and caregiver reported quality of life (QoL) measures. It is also expected that the SRS cohort will require multiple SRS treatments over the course of the study since, unlike WBRT, the treatments target only gross brain metastases and do not address microscopic (clinically undetectable) disease. Conversely, WBRT is expected to result in inferior control rates of gross metastatic disease, increasing the likelihood of subsequent SRS or other salvage therapy. For these reasons, we will track the actual costs of treatments over the course of the study, including the need for supportive care and the ability of patients to continue to work in their previous occupation. The structure of the current study provides a unique opportunity to explore various dosimetric SRS parameters in the setting of multiple brain metastases. Dose-volume criteria for SRS have been established in a prospective RTOG 90-05 dose-finding study and subsequently validated in RTOG 95-08, a randomized controlled trial of WBRT±SRS in patients with 1-3 brain metastases. Several single-institution series as well as multi-institutional retrospective analyses support the use of single-dose SRS for treatment of brain metastases; however, the dose-volume criteria and prescription guidelines are not known in the setting of ≥5 brain metastases where dose interaction among different lesion targets are much more likely. These interactions can potentially lead to increased rates of radiation necrosis, and if the SRS doses are arbitrarily reduced because of such concerns, then to a potentially decreased local control rates. These parameters will be closely tracked in this study with the aim of establishing an evidence-based dosimetric guidelines for radiosurgical treatment of multiple (≥5) brain metastases. The data gained from this study could help define patient selection and treatment criteria for SRS of multiple brain metastases as a potential alternative to WBRT in a select group of patients. This will also be a first study of its kind to use online neurocognitive assessments for its primary endpoints to demonstrate feasibility and cost-effectiveness of such an approach in a multi-institutional setting.',\n",

       "  'A Comparative, Randomised Controlled Trial for Evaluating the Efficacy of Dexamethasone in the Treatment of Patients With Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome',\n",
       "  'BACKGROUND: Currently, there is no proven pharmacologic treatment for patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Great interest remains in the use of corticosteroids for the salvage of patients with severe acute lung injury in the early phase of their disease process, a situation that that has not been evaluated in most published trials. Dexamethasone has never been evaluated in ARDS in a randomized controlled fashion. HYPOTHESIS AND OBJECTIVES: The investigators hypothesize that adjunctive treatment with intravenous dexamethasone of patients with established ARDS might change the pulmonary and systemic inflammatory response and thereby will increase the number of ventilator-free days and will decrease the extremely high overall mortality. Our goal is to examine the effects of dexamethasone on length of duration of mechanical ventilation (assessed by number of ventilator-free days) and on mortality, in patients admitted into a network of Spanish intensive care units (ICUs) who still meet ARDS criteria at 24 hours after ARDS onset.',\n",
       "  'The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is an inflammatory disease process of the lungs as a response to both direct and indirect insults, characterized clinically by severe hypoxemia, reduced lung compliance, and bilateral radiographic infiltrates. ARDS is caused by an insult to the alveolar-capillary membrane that results in increased permeability and subsequent interstitial and alveolar edema. The mechanisms by which a wide variety of insults can lead to this syndrome are not clear. It is useful to think of the pathogenesis of ARDS as a result of two different pathways: a direct insult on lung cells and an indirect insult as a result of an acute systemic inflammatory response. Like any form of inflammation, acute lung injury during ARDS represents a complex process in which multiple cellular signalling pathways can propagate or inhibit lung injury. Death has traditionally been attributed to the underlying disease, the presence of sepsis and the failure of vital organ systems other than the lung. The association of ARDS with multiple system organ dysfunctions is not inevitable, but it certainly is common. It is postulated that local injury to the lungs (pneumonia, trauma, aspiration, gas inhalation) could set up a secondary diffuse inflammatory response resulting in damage to other organs. Although much has evolved in our understanding of its pathogenesis and factors affecting patient outcome, still there is no specific pharmacologic treatment for ARDS. Despite advances in supportive measures and antibiotics, ARDS has a mortality rate of about 40-50% in most series and it is associated with significant health care costs. Patients with ARDS invariably require endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation (MV) to decrease the work of breathing and to improve oxygen transport. To date the only proven, widely accepted method of MV for ARDS is what is called \"lung protective ventilation\" using a low tidal volume strategy plus positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Corticoids seemed to be an ideal therapy for the acute lung injury in ARDS, given their potent anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic properties. They switch off genes that encode pro-inflammatory cytokines and switch on genes that encode anti-inflammatory cytokines. It has been reported that low doses of corticosteroids prevent an extended cytokine response and might accelerate the resolution of pulmonary and systemic inflammation in pneumonia. Dexamethasone has never been evaluated in ARDS in a randomized controlled fashion. However, dexametasone has potent anti-inflammatory effects and weak mineralocorticoid effects compared with other corticosteroids. Dexamethasone has a long-lasting effect, allowing for a once-a-day regimen. Whether addition of dexamethasone to conventional supportive treatment benefits ARDS patients is unknown, it has been used in patients with sepsis, septic shock, pneumonia, trauma, and meningitis, all of them causes of ARDS. The investigators justify the need of our study based on the positive results of two recent clinical trials: (i) Meijvis et al (Lancet 2011) showed that dexamethasone (5 mg/day) for 4 days was able to reduce length of hospital stay in 304 patients with bacterial pneumonia when added to the conventional treatment; (ii) Azoulay et al (Eur Respir J 2011) showed that dexamethasone (10 mg/6h), when added to chemotherapy and conventional ICU management, caused less respiratory deterioration and lower ICU mortality in 40 patients with acute lung injury resulting from leukaemia.',\n",

       "  'The purpose of the study is to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a physician directed nurse managed earlier outpatient counselling intervention for patients with diabetic foot ulceration. For the purpose effectiveness is defined in two ways.1) as a reduction in hospital readmissions for complication for foot ulcers such as amputation or increased severity of the ulcer and 2) reduction in amputations, readmission rates. Selected covariates (self-efficacy,self-management, social support and depression) will be included to estimate predictors for readmission and amputation.',\n",
       "  \"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is associates with numerous complications. One of these is decreased peripheral circulation impaired sensation leading to the development of foot ulcers that lead to amputations of toes, feet and limbs. These complications not only have devastating effects on the individual in terms of loss of functionality but also impact the patient's ability to carry out and enjoy occupational, recreational and family functioning activities. Furthermore, foot ulcers and associated problems often lead to prolonged hospitalization and loss of productivity. All of these have personal as well as societal economical implications. Currently, the standard of care includes admissions to the hospital lasting up to six weeks for medical observations and treatment of food ulcers. The nursing responsibilities include daily or more frequent wound care as well as education counselling and skill building for diabetes self-management; therefore, an alternative to current practices must be considered. Such an alternative strategy has the potential benefit for the patient as well as the societal benefit of economic savings should such an outpatient nurse managed intervention be as or more effective as current practice. This type of service would allow the patients to remain in their home for care with probably a reduced risk for nosocomial infections. This pilot randomized clinical trial (RCT) aims to evaluate the feasibility of an additional patient education program to current management of foot care in patients with DM. We plan to determine whether foot ulcer care in hospital under medical and nursing management can be improved by early discharge of the Intervention group (IG) to the well established outpatient wound care combined with an additional new outpatient nurse managed counselling program. Expected results: This study aims to test an alternative to current standard of care for patients with foot ulcers. A RCT is the preferred method to establish efficacy for this alternative nurse managed intervention; and if found to be effective, the current study will also allow an evaluation of the cost effectiveness of this intervention and the potential economic reduction in cost to the health care system. Also, patients in the hospital are in danger of acquiring nosocomial infections, are subject to medical and nursing errors and are potentially accident prone; all of this together with a general preference for being able to live at home as compared to the hospital, together with the cost savings mentioned above could have a considerable impact on patient's quality of life, satisfaction with care, improvement in food ulcer and amputation outcomes. Significance: The potential implications are major in terms of quality of life, reduction in morbidity in disability days, and cost savings. It is anticipated that this intervention is at least as effective as hospital stay, and being surrounded by their own loved ones without the threats that a hospital setting presents. The findings will be important to consider whether clinical practice can be changed to benefit patients. If the study results show that the subjects in the IG have better skills in monitoring and treating their diabetic foot ulcerations and eventually avoid developing further complications the intervention can be applied to future patients.\",\n",

       "  \"The purpose of this study is to determine the potential efficacy of three revised Medication Guide layouts to increase consumers' comprehension\",\n",
       "  '\\'Medication Guides\\' (Med Guides) are industry-developed documents that have been required by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be issued to consumers for prescription medications that have been viewed to possess \"serious and significant public health concerns\" since 1998.1,2 These materials for consumers are intended to 1) provide specific dosing administration instructions that could prevent serious adverse effects associated with taking the medication, 2) warn individuals about significant health risks that could affect one\\'s decision to take the medication, or 3) underscore the importance of taking the prescribed medication to the patient\\'s health, and the need for proper adherence. Despite their potential value in communicating safe and appropriate medication use, problems are clearly evident with the current template for Med Guides. Research conducted by this team in 2006 showed that the majority, if not all Med Guides dispensed with prescribed medicines are too complex and written at a reading grade level not suitable for the majority of patients to comprehend. As a result, these materials are usually ignored by consumers.3 Further research by this team investigating consumers\\' ability to process and correctly understand content contained in existing Med Guides found that, across all literacy levels, current Med Guides are poorly understood and ineffective in conveying safety information. Patients with low literacy comprehended significantly less, proving yet again that industry standards must be applied to improve these documents. It is clear that the current guidance for Medication Guide development is insufficient, and the FDA is working to change that. Both the FDA and this research team have proposed multiple new Medication Guide formats, most of which are one-page cover sheets that highlight the most important information of the medication. To examine these new prototypes, this research team conducted six focus groups to obtain consumer-based feedback, and then evaluated three of the prototypes in an eye tracking study. Using the collective data from these two consumer-based studies, the investigators have further developed patient-centered and evidence-based Med Guide prototypes that will be more user-friendly, clear, usable, and low literacy appropriate. In a cross-sectional, controlled trial, the investigators will investigate consumers\\' ability to process and correctly understand content contained in each of these top three new, redesigned prototypes. The purpose of this research is to better understand how well people with varying levels of literacy understand information contained in three newly designed Med Guides. Through an in-person interview, the investigators aim to test consumers\\' ability to comprehend information contained in the guides by asking them retrieval and inference questions over the guides\\' content. This will allow us to compare the three formats against each other to see which prototype is most efficient in conveying the important information it is intended to convey. The investigators will recruit a total of 600 participants from general internal medicine clinics here in Chicago (Northwestern clinic = 300 participants and University of Illinois Chicago = 300 participants. A UIC RA will be responsible for this recruitment and will submit their own IRB for review). This trial will field test our enhanced prototypes and allow us to compare them to each other, showing which format is best understood, especially in participants with low literacy.',\n",

       "  'Atrial fibrillation (AF) is growing into an epidemic affecting 1 in 4 adults. There is a need for research to elucidate the prevalence of ischemic cardiomyopathy in patients diagnosed with AF. The objective of this study is to demonstrate the utility of MRI in assessment of coronary artery disease. The specific objective is to demonstrate sensitivity/specificity comparable to that reported in meta-analyses of non-AF patients and adenosine (90% /80%) in an AF population using the time-efficient vasodilator regadenoson that requires only a single intravenous (IV).',\n",
       "  'Scientific Background/Rationale: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a large and growing healthcare problem worldwide. Over 7 million people in the U.S. and Europe currently suffer from atrial fibrillation, and this number is expected to double before 2050. The lifetime risk of AF is high: ~24% at age 40, and this risk remains fairly constant at older ages, with 22% lifetime risk at age 80 [1]. AF significantly increases the risk of stroke and mortality, and can greatly limit quality of life. Little research has been done on AF and ischemic cardiomyopathy, though it is a relatively common co-morbidity. CT found increased prevalence (41% vs 27%) of coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with AF compared to patients with similar pre-test risk but no AF [2]. AF patients with a positive SPECT scan for CAD have a worse prognosis for cardiac events than patients with positive SPECT but without AF [3]. It was recently reported that in a study of 253 AF patients, that AF patients with positive SPECT studies had a very high number of false positives - only 15% of patients had significant CAD by angiography (compared to 67% in the control group) [4, 5]. Just over half of the patients were in sinus rhythm at SPECT, but since similar numbers of positives were seen in each half, the authors did not feel that imaging during AF was the cause of the poor specificity. Use of MRI for assessment of CAD is a growing area that entails no radiation exposure to the patient. Advances in MRI have made it possible to accurately detect CAD, either as well or better than SPECT in unselected populations [6, 7]. However, adoption of MRI myocardial perfusion scans has been limited in part due to the challenges associated with the use of adenosine. Adenosine requires starting a second IV, and to use either a special expensive MRI-compatible infusion pump to deliver the drug, or long lengths of tubing to run to a pump outside the scanner room. Neither solution is ideal, and regadenoson would not require any such pumps or the starting of a second IV. Here the investigators propose to determine the sensitivity/specificity for dynamic contrast-enhanced myocardial perfusion MRI with the vasodilator regadenoson in a subpopulation of patients - those with atrial fibrillation. The investigators have a great deal of experience with stress and rest myocardial perfusion MRI. In a preliminary study imaging three patients with AF that then went to X-ray angiography (cath), two of the three subjects had significant stenoses by cath, and one did not. This agreed with the regadenoson stress perfusion MRI findings. These MRI acquisitions were performed on a Siemens Verio MRI scanner. The Verio operates at twice the magnetic field strength (3 Tesla, or 3T) of most MRI scanners, which operate at 1.5T. The higher magnetic field offers images with significantly less noise (almost twice the signal-to-noise ratio). Objective: To demonstrate sensitivity/specificity comparable to that reported in meta-analyses of non-AF patients and adenosine (90%/80% [6, 7]), in an atrial fibrillation population while using the time-efficient vasodilator regadenoson that requires only a single IV. Study Design: This will be a prospective, open-label, comparative trial using MRI. Non-invasive MRI measurements of resting flow and flow at regadenoson stress will be obtained in each subject during a one hour MRI exam using our advanced MRI acquisition techniques. 32 subjects will be recruited for this study. Study Procedure: Each subject will undergo a single MRI scanning session. Caffeine will be stopped 12 hours prior to the procedure. One IV will be started and subjects positioned in the scanner. Resting perfusion with Multihance Gd-BOPTA contrast agent will be performed first. The perfusion acquisition acquires 3-6 short axis slices each heartbeat and lasts for one minute. Then a standard regadenoson injection of 400ug/5cc will be given and MR imaging performed with a Gd-BOPTA contrast agent bolus 60-100 seconds later [9] [10].',\n",

       "  \"The planned study will randomly assign aggressive children to one of two versions of the Coping Power child component. The two versions of Coping Power will either deliver the child component of the program in the usual small group format (Group Coping Power: GCP) or in a newly-developed individual format (Individual Coping Power: ICP). By providing a direct comparison of two different formats of the same intervention, the planned study's design will fill a critical gap in our current understanding of the relative effectiveness of group vs. individual programs. Further, this study will allow for examination of the specific factors that influence relative effectiveness of these two formats, important information with broad implications for program development, training of clinicians, and intervention implementation.\",\n",
       "  \"Specific Aim 1: The study will test the hypothesis that the Coping Power intervention will produce larger effect sizes when delivered in an individual format in comparison to a group format. Although there are advantages of both formats, pilot data suggests that the group format may be diminishing the strength of outcome effects of intervention in comparison to the same intervention delivered in individual format. This pilot data is consistent with some prior findings, but a direct randomized comparison of children assigned to group versus individual formats has not been conducted, despite the critically important conceptual, clinical, and policy implications. Hypothesis 1-1: It is hypothesized that ICP will produce greater reductions in behavior outcomes including substance use, externalizing behavior problems, and delinquency at a 1-year follow-up, in comparison to GCP. Hypothesis 1-2: it is hypothesized that the ICP condition will produce greater improvements in children's social competence, which is directly targeted by the intervention, in comparison to GCP. Specific Aim 2: Individual and group variation in effect sizes will be an outcome of youth behavior in the group (i.e., deviancy training) and group leader behavior management skill. We see youth behavior to be highly influenced by group leader management practices. We understand that some groups and/or individual children present challenges to even the most competent group leaders, and therefore, variation will be observable and meaningful. The design of the study allows for the testing of both group level and individual effects, and linkage of these effects to specific behaviors. Such information will provide an empirical basis for clinical training for group interventions with youth in general and Coping Power in particular. Hypothesis 2-1: It is hypothesized that peer escalation in the GCP condition will predict worse outcomes, and that the level of group deviance in the GCP condition will moderate the effectiveness of the GCP condition, with better outcome effects for the groups with the highest initial screening scores. Hypothesis 2-2: It is hypothesized that group interventions will be compromised by individual children's reactions to the interpersonal dynamics of the groups, such as inadvertent attention to deviant behavior and talk provided by group members and/or the group leader. Hypothesis 2-3: It is hypothesized that level of positive group leader behaviors (directing attention to rules, correcting behavior, providing praise for compliance, introduction and review of activities, clear directions) will moderate the effectiveness of the GCP condition. Specific Aim 3: Variability in outcome scores will differ between conditions. Hypothesis 3-1: It is hypothesized that there will be greater variability in the outcome scores of children in the GCP condition than in those of children in the ICP condition. Specific Aim 4: Child characteristics will be examined as potential moderators of intervention effects. Hypothesis 4-1: It is hypothesized that youth with low effortful control will be most vulnerable to deviancy effects in group interventions and therefore will show lower effect sizes than youth higher in effortful control at baseline. Thus we expect effortful control to function as a moderator of group intervention effectiveness, but not individual intervention effectiveness. Research Question 1: In addition, we will investigate the possibility that characteristics of the youth's decision-making (impulsive decision-making; outcome expectations), affective arousal (callous-unemotional traits; low physiological arousal in response to negative consequences), temperament and behavior characteristics (baseline severity of aggressive behavior); perceived and actual peer reactions (perceived peer competence; peer rejection; peer victimization; deviant peers) and demographic characteristics (sex; age; race) will moderate the effectiveness of both interventions.\",\n",

Hence, total 32 subjects will be enrolled in the study considering withdrawal and dropouts. Screening procedures: Demographic data, medical and medication histories, complete physical examination, height, weight and BMI as well as 12 lead ECG, chest X-ray [PA view], vital signs [blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate and oral temperature], hematology, biochemistry, HIV 1 & 2, Hepatitis B and C, RPR test for Syphilis and urine analysis will be done at screening. Urine drug screen, Liver chemistry test and breath alcohol test to be done prior to each check-in. Breath alcohol test to be done prior to each ambulatory visit blood collection. Liver chemistry test to be done at the end of each period. Housing: The study subjects will be housed at least 11 h prior to drug administration until after the 24 h blood sampling in each study period. The housing will be followed by one ambulatory visits [36.0 hr post dose] for each period. Washout: At least 7 days, but not exceeding 14 days between two dosing days. Treatment arms: Test: A single dose of Metformin 500 mg tablet manufactured by Savipharm J.S.C, Vietnam. Reference: A single dose of Glucophage® 500 mg tablet of Merck Sante, France Drug administration: As per the randomization schedule, one tablet of either test or reference product will be orally administered to each subject in each period in sitting posture, after an overnight fast of at least 10 h. To avoid hypoglycemic episodes, the investigational products will be administered with 240 mL of a 20% glucose solution in water, followed by 60 mL of the glucose solution administered every 15 min for up to 4 h after dosing. Subjects will be instructed not to chew or crush the tablet but should be swallowed. Compliance for dosing will be assessed by identification of subjects with subject ID card, identification of label on investigational product to confirm correct allocation of treatment and checking the oral cavity immediately after dosing. Restrictions: Subjects will remain in upright position [sitting or ambulatory] for two hours after dosing in each period except when clinically indicated to change the posture. The subjects will fast for at least 10 h prior to dosing and 4 h post-dose. Water will be permitted ad libitum except for 1 h before and until 1 h after post dose. During 1 hr post dose water restriction a, 60 mL of 20% glucose solution will be administered every 15 min to the study subjects. In each period of the study, 18 blood samples of 6 mL each will be collected in K2EDTA vacutainers via an indwelling catheter placed in one of the forearm veins. Heparin-lock technique will be used to prevent clotting of blood in the indwelling catheter. Before each in-house blood sample is drawn through catheter, 0.5 mL of blood will be discarded so as to purge the heparin containing blood sample in the catheter. Blood can also be collected by direct venipuncture in case of cannula blockage, during ambulatory visits or for any other practical reasons. The two pre-dose blood samples will be collected within a period of 1 h before the drug administration. The post-dose blood samples will be collected at 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 8.0, 10.0, 12.0, 16.0, 24.0 and 36.0 h. The 36.0 h post dose blood samples will be collected during ambulatory visits by direct venipuncture. Immediately after collection of blood, the sample will be kept in ice bath. After collecting the blood samples from all the subjects at each sampling time point, samples will be centrifuged at 4oC with 3500 rpm for 10 minutes. The plasma samples will be separated and stored in pre-labeled polypropylene tubes at -70 ± 10°C pending assay. The time interval between sample collection and the start of centrifugation should not exceed more than 45 minutes. The blood sample collection, processing and analysis will be done under sodium monochromatic light. The total volume of blood drawn including the volume necessary for the laboratory tests, PK sample analysis and the volume of blood discarded before each in house blood draw will be about 250 mL per subject for the entire study. Subjects monitoring: Brief physical examination and vital signs [blood pressure, pulse rate and oral temperature] will be carried out and recorded at each check-in and at check-out. Vital signs [blood pressure and pulse rate] will also be recorded before dosing of investigational products, between 2 - 3, 9 - 10 and 36.0 h post dose. Vital signs should be done in sitting position after rest of at least 5 minutes. Physical examination and measurement of vital signs can also be carried out at any time during the conduct of the study if the Investigator/Doctor feels it necessary. In case of abnormality in pre-dose vital signs, Investigator based on his medical judgement will take the decision whether to dose the subject or not. During vitals recording each subject will be asked about his well-being. Also subject well-being questionnaire will be performed at 1.0 and 5.0 h post dose. Post-study Procedures: . Safety evaluation [complete physical examination, vital signs, hematology [except blood grouping & Rh typing] and biochemistry] will be done at the end of the clinical part of the study. In case of any withdrawals during the study safety assessment will be done at the time of withdrawal. In case of dropouts subjects will be asked to visit the facility to undergo safety assessments Pharmacokinetic Parameters: Cmax, Tmax, AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, AUC%_Extrap, Kel and t1/2 Analytical Methods: Metformin in plasma will be estimated using validated LC-MS/MS method. Statistical Methods: Statistical analyses will be done using SAS® version 9.2 or higher. Analysis of variance [ANOVA] for log-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters [Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞], two one-sided tests [Schuirmann] for bioequivalence, power, ratio and 90% confidence interval for log-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters - Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ will be performed. Standards for Bioequivalence: The calculated 90% Confidence Interval for the test to reference ratio of Metformin should fall within the range of 80%-125% for log transformed Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ for the conclusion of bioequivalence. Adverse Events The investigator or site staff is responsible for detecting, documenting and reporting events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE. AEs will be collected from the start of Study Treatment and until the follow-up contact. Medical occurrences that begin prior to the start of study treatment but after obtaining informed consent may be recorded on the Medical History/Current Medical Conditions CRF. SAEs will be collected over the same time period as stated above for AEs. However, any SAEs assessed as related to study participation (e.g. study treatment, protocol-mandated procedures, invasive tests, or change in existing therapy) or related to a GSK concomitant medication will be recorded from the time a subject consents to participate in the study up to and including any follow-up contact. All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the sponsor within 24 hours. Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in former study participants. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a subject has been discharged from the study, and he considers the event reasonably related to the study treatment or study participation, the investigator would promptly notify the sponsor. All serious adverse events will be informed to the sponsor within 24 hrs and to the IEC within 7 working days. Any unexpected serious adverse event (SAE) occurring during a clinical trial should be communicated promptly (within 14 calendar days) by the Sponsor/CRO to the Licensing Authority. Any follow-up information on a previously reported SAE will also be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours. If the investigator does not have all information regarding an SAE, he/she will not wait to receive additional information before notifying the sponsor of the event and completing the appropriate data collection tool. The investigator will always provide an assessment of causality at the time of the initial report.',\n",

Individuals homozygous for the short 5-HTTLPR allele thus appear to be more sensitive to the effect of life stress, which in turn contributes to depression onset. A recent study showed that short allele carriers presented with a threat (social or other threats) who also had high levels of testosterone had elevated cortisol after exposure to the threat. There is neurobiological evidence that short allele status, elevated testosterone levels, and elevated cortisol levels are all linked to amygdala hyper-reactivity to the same classes of environmental threats. Thus, this study will test, for the first time, a potential interaction between 5-HTTLPR status and experimentally manipulated cortisol levels as risk factors for downstream mood and/or anxiety disorders by examining potential dysregulated stress responses among short allele carriers who have elevated cortisol levels.',\n",

       "  \"Experimental Design and Methods: This will be a prospective randomized controlled trial of intubation using the C-MAC video laryngoscope versus standard laryngoscopy for patients requiring emergent intubation in the Emergency Department. Study Setting and Population: This study will be performed at an urban county medical center with approximately 97,000 patient visits per year. Adult patients (age >17) requiring intubation will be enrolled. Study Protocol: All ED patients who are unable to adequately breathe on their own requiring emergent intubation for airway management will be screened for inclusion in the study. Identified patients will be deemed eligible when the need for intubation has been determined by the treating physician. Eligible patients will be placed on capnograph, cardiac, blood pressure and pulse oximetry monitors. Patients will be randomly assigned to be intubated using standard laryngoscopy with the C-MAC blade or C-MAC videolaryngoscope. Sealed envelopes containing the randomization assignment for the treatment groups will be kept at the patient's bedside in the stabilization room. Patients will be monitored by oxygen saturation, blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate, which are typical for patients requiring intubation in our ED. Data will be recorded every minute by a trained research assistant at the patient's bedside. The lowest oxygen saturation during the procedure will be recorded for determination of hypoxia. Hypoxia will be defined as an oxygen saturation <93%. The number of attempts made to intubate and the total time to successful intubation will be recorded. An attempt starts when the intubating device enters the patients mouth and ends when the endotracheal tube placement is confirmed or when a new intubating device is put in the patients mouth after the previous device had been removed. Data collection includes the timing and number of breaths given via Bag-Valve-Mask and patient repositioning between the attempts. All treatments will be recorded. Data collection will continue until the patient is discharged from the Emergency Department. The patient's diagnosis at the time of discharge from the ED will be recorded. Patients' charts will be reviewed to determine the diagnosis, occurrence of aspiration pneumonia, ICU length of stay, and inpatient length of stay. Two attempts will be made to contact patients 28 days after study enrollment to determine their condition at that time. Data Analysis: Data will be collected by a designated research assistant during the procedure and will then be entered into an EXCEL (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA) database for storage. Data will be exported into STATA 10.0 (STATA Corp., College Station, TX) for further analysis. The number of attempts to successful intubation and total time to intubation will be compared using descriptive statistics. Occurrence of hypoxia and aspiration pneumonia will be compared in patients who were intubated with the C-MAC to patients intubated with standard laryngoscopy using Chi-Square tests. Oxygen saturation, ETCO2, and heart rate will be compared in both groups using multiple linear regression. The length of stay and 28 day follow up between the two groups will be compared using Wilcoxon rank sum tests. In order to detect a 15% difference in the length of stay between the two groups, with a power of 80% and an alpha of 0.05, 100 patients will be required in each group for a total of 200 patients.\",\n",

During the procedure, you will be able to talk with the MRI staff through a speaker system. You can tell them to stop the scan at any time. The MRI produces a loud hammering noise, which has produced hearing loss in a very small number of patients. You will be given earplugs to reduce this risk. Loss of confidentiality: 1. your name, diagnosis, age, gender and potential treatment could be accessed by non-research team individuals. Intravenous Catheter Insertion: For this study you will need to have small amount of blood drawn for laboratory studies to make sure that it is safe for you to participate in the study. You will have an intravenous catheter (IV) placed peripherally (usually arm or hand) for infusion of the study drug, ferumoxytol. There are minimal risks associated with placement of the IV, including pain, bleeding, bruising, and infection at the IV site. Women Capable of Becoming Pregnant If you are a woman who is capable of becoming pregnant, we will ask you to have a pregnancy test before beginning this study. You must use effective birth control methods and try not to become pregnant while participating in this study.

       "  \"One of the most serious challenges facing antiretroviral therapy (ART) programs for HIV/AIDS in resource-constrained settings is the failure of ART-eligible patients to complete the steps required to initiate treatment. The high rate of loss to care of patients who are treatment-eligible at HIV diagnosis may be due in part to the large number of steps required between receiving an HIV diagnosis and obtaining the first dose of antiretrovirals (ARVs). In South Africa, these steps usually require approximately four clinic visits over a period of 2-8 weeks before a patient can start treatment. One strategy proposed for reducing losses among those eligible for ART is to simplify and condense the steps required for starting treatment. This is now possible because new, point-of-care (POC) tests for CD4 counts and tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis are available. These technologies can be combined with changes to clinic schedules to allow all steps required for ART initiation under South African guidelines (lab tests, physical exam, education) to take place on the day the patient presents for an HIV test. This study is a randomized strategy evaluation of the feasibility, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of rapid ART initiation. Outpatient, non-pregnant, HIV-positive adults who come to a South African clinic for an HIV test, consent to study participation, and are eligible for ART will be randomized 1:1 to rapid ART initiation or to standard care. Those who are assigned to rapid ART initiation will have the possibility of receiving their first dose of ARVs as early as the same day, while those who are assigned to standard care will follow the clinic's usual procedures for starting ART. Rapid ART initiation for HIV-positive pregnant women, which has recently become the standard of care in South Africa, will also be assessed in a programmatic evaluation conducted alongside the randomized evaluation, with a retrospective comparison group. The primary study outcome for non-pregnant adults will be remaining alive, in care and virally suppressed 10 months after having a positive HIV test at the study site or making a first HIV-related visit. The primary study outcome for pregnant women will be adherence to ART until delivery. The cost effectiveness of the rapid initiation strategy will be assessed as the cost per patient achieving the primary outcome for each population.\",\n",

This study will compare a standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy with epirubicin plus ifosfamide versus a histology-driven chemotherapy, i.e. a chemotherapy tailored to the specific histology within the family of adult STS. Chemotherapy will be administered for 3 cycles. There will be five histological groups (representing 80% of STS), as follows: leiomyosarcoma, myxoid liposarcoma with hypercellularity (round cell MLPS), synovial sarcoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma. The histology-driven chemotherapy for these groups will be, respectively, gemcitabine plus dacarbazine, trabectedin, high-dose ifosfamide, ifosfamide plus etoposide, gemcitabine plus docetaxel. Other histological groups will also be included and registered, but treated only by standard chemotherapy. Patients who have already undergone definitive surgery will receive treatment post-operatively and patients needing a re-excision after inadequate surgery will be treated as patients in the two groups, but of course will not be evaluable for response. A centralized pathological review will be performed. Radiological response will be evaluated according to RECIST and to Choi criteria. Pathological response will also be recorded. The endpoint will be disease-free survival (DFS) and, secondarily, overall survival (OS) of patients receiving standard chemotherapy versus those receiving histotype-tailored chemotherapy. Additional aims will be to compare the probability of response of standard vs histotype-tailored chemotherapy and to determine the radiological and pathological response with standard chemotherapy vs tailored chemotherapy in each different histological group. Another aim will be to validate the response (both radiological and pathological) to preoperative chemotherapy as a surrogate endpoint for DFS and OS. Three hundred patients will be randomized over a 3-years period, from a pool of 400-450 registered patients. Translational research will be performed. Areas of research will include identification and validation of the potential predictive markers for each histological subgroups. The study is designed to verify the statistical hypothesis that histotype-tailored approach is associated, overall, with a 30% reduction in the hazard of relapse. However, in each different histological group, the effect of histotype-tailored chemotherapy, as compared to standard chemotherapy, can be different. To address this weakness an orthogonal study of response to chemotherapy as a surrogate of DFS and OS has been introduced into the trial. This study intends to extensively investigate the response (radiological and pathological) to preoperative chemotherapy and to validate it as a surrogate endpoint by showing that it correlates with disease free survival and overall survival.',\n",

       "  \"Women and OEF/OIF/OND Reserve/National Guard (RNG) war Veterans are among the fastest growing groups of new VA users. Although PTSD is highly prevalent in this group of Veterans, most choose not to seek care for a variety of reasons. Facilitating access to mental health (MH) services for RNG OEF/OIF/OND female Veterans with PTSD is challenging and requires new approaches to outreach. Such approaches are urgently needed to mediate the severity of post-deployment MH conditions, alleviate concerns over MH diagnoses, and interrupt the cycle of chronicity found in many with PTSD. This gap between need for and use of VA PTSD services suggests that further research is needed to understand specific barriers to VA MH care and VA PTSD evidence-based psychotherapy (EBP). A web-based interface tailored to consumer needs has the potential to promote active engagement by Veterans in their health care. Considering that OEF/OIF combat Veterans enrolled in VA care report a preference to seek readjustment services or information over the internet, such an approach may have important advantages for engaging this group. Furthermore, evidence indicates that when patients are educated about their physical health conditions and treatment alternatives, shared decision-making results in increased treatment participation, better adherence to treatment recommendations, and better health outcomes. Although highly promising, web-based and shared-decision making approaches to facilitating VA MH treatment utilization are in need of further study. In Phase 1 of the project, the investigators will use qualitative methods to assess VA enrolled PTSD positive OEF/OIF/OND RNG female war Veterans' perceptions, preferences and barriers and facilitators to accessing VA MH services and EBP for PTSD. This information will be used to refine the investigators' existing web-based interface to better address these issues. Satisfaction with the revised interface will then be assessed. Phase 2 will focus on comparing the efficacy of two approaches to promoting VHA initiation. Participants who screen positive for PTSD on the web interface will be randomly assigned to: 1) Study concierge nurse case manager (NCM) facilitated shared decision making to assist with VA MH evaluation and treatment; or 2) existing outreach (current standard of care). Follow-up assessments will be conducted at 6 and 12 months to determine whether and where participants sought MH care (from both VA and non-VA resources). This study will provide valuable insights about this population's perceptions of VA MH services and of PTSD EBP, as well as their evolving use of VA and other community resources to address PTSD and other post-deployment MH needs. Furthermore, it will provide important information regarding the efficacy of relatively inexpensive and resource-sparing interventions that can be readily implemented within existing and emerging (e.g., Patient Alight Care Teams [PACT]) models of VA care delivery. While the proposed web interface and shared decision-making intervention are currently directed at RNG women Veterans post-deployment, there are clear implications for expansion to other populations and health/MH concerns, as well. Findings have important policy implications for several operational partners heavily invested in the improved access and delivery of evidence-based mental health care for Veterans with PTSD.\",\n",

As immunity against these infections is likely to be primarily mediated by antibodies in mucosal secretions, developing techniques to increase the levels and persistence of antiviral antibody on mucosal surfaces may enhance the protection against a number of important infections. Preclinical studies have anatomically targeted vaccine antigens to sites where genital tract immunity is induced. This response is likely due to the ability of regional lymph Preclinical studies have anatomically targeted vaccine antigens to sites where genital tract immunity is induced. This response is likely due to the ability of regional lymph nodes to \"pattern\" the cell surface markers of responding vaccine specific lymphocytes with homing markers. In contrast, injecting a distant muscle (such as in the arm) which shares no anatomical relationship with the vagina, may not pattern cells with homing markers for the genital tract. Direct injection of inguinal lymph nodes is impractical in humans but intramuscular injection into the thigh will target antigens to the deep inguinal lymph nodes shared in common with the cervix/vagina. This study will be a Phase IV randomised, single centre, open label, laboratory assessment blinded exploratory trial to assess mucosal immunogenicity following three targeted intramuscular immunisations with TicoVac vaccine. 20 subjects will be randomised to each of2 groups immunised in right deltoid or right anterolateral thigh. Following an initial screening visit subjects will be immunised at 0, 1 and 6 months. There will be follow up visits 5 days after each immunisation and a final visit at 7 months. Blood samples and cervicovaginal secretions will be taken prior to each immunisation for immunological measures. In addition, blood samples will be taken at each immunisation and follow up visit for measurement of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The study is funded by ADITEC, which is a collaborative research programme that aims to accelerate the development of novel and powerful immunisation technologies for the next generation of human vaccines.',\n",
       "  'The study will investigate whether targeting vaccine antigens to lymph nodes (internal iliac) which drain both the lower limb and the cervix/vagina alters the subsequent antibody response detected in the cervix/vagina, when compared with targeting vaccine antigens to unrelated lymph nodes such as those in the axilla that drain the right deltoid muscle of upper arm. The right arm has been specifically selected as lymphatics in the right upper part of the body drains directly into the blood stream via the right lymphatic duct with no shared lymphatic connections to the rest of the body. In contrast lymph from the rest of the body ultimately drains into the thoracic duct (see figure below). By immunising the right arm the investigators can be sure that vaccine antigens and antigen presenting cells and activated lymphocytes will not pass through any lymph nodes in common with the cervix or vagina. In contrast by injecting the anterolateral thigh (right side selected for uniformity) the investigators can be sure that vaccine antigens will pass through the external inguinal lymph nodes which will also receive antigens and lymphocytes responding to vaginal or cervical infection or inflammation. The choice of right leg is just to standardise. It is the investigators hypothesis therefore that as a result of antigen presentation and stimulation within a specifically \"genital tract milieu\" T &B lymphocytes leaving the external iliac nodes as a result of an immunisation into the thigh will be patterned in such a way as to more likely home back to the cervix and vagina due to the common drainage of the cervix, vagina and thigh (Figure 1) into the external iliac and lateral aortic lymph nodes. In contrast, cells leaving the axillary lymph nodes after immunisation of the right arm will enter the blood directly via the right lymphatic duct and so will not pass through any lymph nodes in common with the cervix and vagina. The investigators will detect an effect of targeted immunisation in a number of ways: 1. By detecting increased levels of vaccine-specific antibodies in cervico-vaginal secretions as a result of more activated B cells (plasmablasts) homing back to the genital tract. IgG antibodies may be transudated from the blood but local mucosal IgG may also be produced. In contrast, mucosal IgA is most likely to be locally produced and may therefore be preferentially affected by targeted immunisation. However as individual levels of mucosal antibody vary widely between subjects, especially with IgA, the investigators will set primary endpoints on the basis of a fold-increase in antibody levels from baseline, rather than concentration. As mucosal IgG responses are generally more reliable and of greater magnitude the investigators have set the primary objective as vaccine-specific mucosal IgG after all three immunisations. Vaccine-specific mucosal IgA responses after all three immunisations are the secondary objective. The study has been powered on the basis of the investigators limited experience with similar vaccines to detect a doubling of proportions of responders for IgG and IgA. The investigators have based the fold-increase in vaccine-specific mucosal IgG and IgA on the investigators limited experience with a similar vaccine injected into the arm(7). In addition, the investigators will measure changes in other variables that are exploratory in nature as assays and quantification are less well established: 2. By detecting a \"mucosal\" pattern of B cell responses in the blood with increased numbers of vaccine-specific B cells after genital targeted immunisation. 3. By detecting differences in the cell surface phenotypic markers on vaccine-specific lymphocytes indicating a mucosal origin. There will be two treatment groups: - Group 1 will receive the vaccine in the right deltoid muscle (upper arm) which drains to unrelated lymph nodes in the axilla. - Group 2 will receive the vaccine in the upper anterolateral right thigh, from which antigens will be expected to drain to the inguinal lymph nodes that also drain the cervix/vagina. To ensure complete disconnection of draining lymph nodes it will always be the RIGHT arm or RIGHT leg that is immunised. It is hypothesised that targeting the internal iliac nodes will lead to an enhanced mucosal antibody response in the cervix/vagina, which will be detected by increased vaccine-specific IgA in cervico-vaginal secretions collected in a Softcup. In addition, lymphocytes (B and T cells) from external iliac lymph nodes may carry surface markers associated with mucosal homing and secrete different combinations of cytokines (Th17) than those emanating from axillary nodes which will express a systemic phenotype. This can be detected by flow cytometry, ELISPOT after bead separation using phenotypic markers, and other immunological assays. Immune response readouts will be IgG and IgA antibodies against the TBEV antigens in the vaccine, comparing the two groups at the time point when the peak response is expected (28 days after third immunisation). As the investigators wish to investigate the ability of the vaccine to specifically prime subjects in a targeted way, participants must be naive to the vaccine antigens and so must not have had the vaccine or TBEV infection before. Therefore the investigators will use TicoVac - a TBEV vaccine licenced in the UK that UK adults have not generally received, as TBEV infection is not endemic in the UK. TicoVac is widely used in central and eastern Europe where TBEV is endemic but extremely uncommon, and is offered to travellers from UK to endemic areas who are likely to engage in high risk activity (hiking, trekking). Mucosal responses against TBEV are not relevant as TBEV is transmitted by tick bites. Immune responses to TicoVac will act as a model for other vaccines in which the mucosal antibody response in the vagina is of relevance to block infection (e.g. HIV, HPV, HSV) and in which targeted immunisation may increase efficacy. Although strictly speaking the induction of anti-TBEV antibodies in cervico-vaginal secretions is of no relevance to the efficacy of the TicoVac vaccine against a blood-injected virus, the investigators have designated them as parameters of efficacy in this model of targeted immunisation. The purpose of this human immune physiology study is to use TBEV vaccine as a model neoantigen to investigate immune readouts after antigen targeting. The collection of adverse event or safety data is therefore not relevant to the study objectives and there will be no systematic collection of safety data, other than those required for a Risk Assessed \"Type A\" CTIMP (SUSAR reporting to MHRA/REC/Concerned Investigators, Annual List of Suspected Serious Adverse Reactions as part of the Annual Safety Report/Development Safety Update Report).',\n",

       "  \"The prevalence of overweight and obesity among older adults has reached an all-time high, which puts this age group at high risk for associated comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and certain forms of cancer. Confronted with declining incomes and economic uncertainty, many middle-aged and older Americans tried to save on their food purchases during the 2007-2009 recession. Grocery coupons, available through newspapers, mail, and increasingly online, are one of several promotional tools that supermarkets and warehouse clubs use to promote sales. It is estimated that nationally 27% of households are frequent grocery coupon users who shop at a variety of retailers. Despite the increasing popularity of grocery coupons, little is known about the extent to which they may promote obesogenic home food environments and eating behaviors. Many coupons advertise the purchase of large quantities of prepackaged and processed foods and often reward shoppers by adding 'free' products if they purchase certain quantities. Availability and easy accessibility of large portions of energy dense foods in the home has been shown to promote increased intake. The proposed study seeks to examine the effects of frequent grocery coupon usage on dietary intake, weight status, and home food availability among middle-aged and older adults. A second aim of this study is to test, in a randomized-controlled trial, the effects of incentivizing grocery coupon use for the purchase of healthy foods on 3-month changes in dietary intake, body mass index/waist circumference, home food availability, and grocery coupon use among frequent coupon users and non-coupon users.\",\n",

On the day of the study participant\\'s planned amputation revision, research staff will liaise with surgical staff to coordinate nerve specimen retrieval. If a patient is to have an above the knee amputation, a sciatic nerve specimen will be obtained, if a patient is to have a below the knee or through knee amputation, a tibial nerve specimen will be obtained (the major component of the sciatic nerve after it divides into the tibial and peroneal nerves in the popliteal fossa of the knee). The surgeon will place a suture in the proximal end of the specimen to indicate the non-traumatized end of the nerve, as well as provide an estimate of the longitudinal location of the nerve sampled (i.e. 10cm distal to the knee joint line, 15 cm proximal to the knee at the knee joint level).

The promixal, middle, and distal samples will be obtained at the DRP lab and the remaining segments of nerve will be replaced in the -80 freezer for future analysis. Samples will then be sent to Duke University for processing and analysis via a secure air mail carrier.

Collaborator Dr Moseley\\'s lab responsibilities include both protein extraction and assay. The number of extractions per sample will vary depending on its length, from 2 to about 50. Collaborator Dr Van de ven\\'s lab responsibilities include sample handling, pathologic examination, removing thin slices for histologic examination and segment homogenization for RNA,DNA and protein extraction. Individual segments will be thawed on ice and homogenized immediately upon thawing. Homogenization methods will be optimized to produce the highest dissolved protein content. Methods to be trialed will include sonication, mechanical disruption by laboratory blender, mechanical disruption by manual chopping followed by Potter device, and freeze thawing. Buffer and solvent system variables to be trialed include salt concentration, pH and buffer type, chaotrope concentration (urea and thiourea), presence of organic co-solvents such as DMSO, and the presence of nonionic detergent. All homogenization will be performed between 0 and 4°C and in the presence of protease inhibitors. For proteomic analysis, High-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray mass spectrometry will be employed as a complementary route to discovering differences in protein expression between healthy and traumatized tissue. Following solid-phase extraction of soluble and solubilized proteins, we will optimize conditions for separation of protein peaks detected by UV absorbance and/or total ion current and may employ more than one set of conditions in order to focus on different sets of extracted proteins. We will use high-porosity C-18 reversed-phase columns to separate cytosolic proteins, and C-4 for membrane proteins. Standard methods of ionization, fragmentation, and detection will be used that are consistent with the Shimadzu LCMS-IT-TOF mass spectrometer at the Research Operations Service (ROS).

The study will be conducted in Jamnagar district in Gujarat state in India. The hypothesis is that a program to deliver oral misoprostol and one to deliver oxytocin via Uniject® will both be effective in preventing PPH when introduced in community-based settings.',\n",
       "  'Rationale for Research: Approximately 30% of maternal deaths in India are attributed to postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). The most common cause of PPH is uterine atony (failure of the uterus to contract properly after childbirth). Administration of an uterotonic drug as active management in the third stage of labor (AMTSL) can significantly reduce the rate of PPH. Oxytocin is considered the drug of choice for prevention of PPH. However, it is not always feasible to administer parenteral Oxytocin in resource-poor settings given the cold storage, sterile equipment, skilled personnel, and administration requirements. Recently, Oxytocin in Uniject®, a pre-filled, non-refillable easy to use device with a single measured dose has been found to be equally effective and safer and more convenient to use than traditional needle and syringe. Misoprostol has been explored for preventing PPH in settings where parenteral uterotonics are not yet available or feasible to use. In 2007, the World Health Organisation in its guidelines on prevention of PPH endorsed the administration of oral Misoprostol for PPH prevention by unskilled providers \"trained in its use in settings where Active management of the third stage of labor (AMTSL) is not practiced\". In spite of the evidence of clinical safety and efficacy of oral Misoprostol and/or Oxytocin in Uniject® as universal PPH prevention drugs, to date, there have been no studies comparing the programmatic effectiveness of either technology on a large scale or in nationwide PPH prevention programs. To address this gap, the investigators plan to conduct a large community-based trial in collaboration with the Aga Khan Health Services, India. Study Objectives: The study will assess the feasibility, cost, risks and benefits of use of oral Misoprostol and parenteral Oxytocin in Uniject® as prophylaxis for PPH in community settings. Study Design: The study is designed as a community-based cluster Randomised Control Trial. The study will enroll women delivering at Primary Health Centres (PHCs). Study centres will be assigned to one of the following: Group 1: 600 mcg oral Misoprostol, Group 2: 10 IU IM Oxytocin delivered by Uniject®. Study Procedures 1. Informed consent /Enrollment: Women will be approached by trained study staff in the third trimester or when they present for delivery and asked if they wish to participate in the study. Women who meet the study\\'s eligibility criteria and agree to participate will be asked to provide written consent. After enrollment, their baseline data will be recorded and a pre-delivery hemoglobin assessment will be done. 2. At time of delivery: Standard procedures to manage the delivery will be followed. Immediately after delivery, participants will be given the assigned study medication (either Misoprostol or Oxytocin by Uniject®). The provider will monitor the women for side effects for 1 - 2 hours after delivery. Referrals will be carried out as per standard of care in each setting and documented. 3. After delivery: The follow up visit will be conducted by a trained community health worker. Post-delivery Hb will be recorded for all women approximately 72 hours after delivery. Women\\'s experiences of side effects, and acceptability and satisfaction with her care will be documented. Study Site and Sample: The study will be conducted in the Jamnagar district in Gujarat,India. Twenty seven PHCs will be considered eligible for participation. To detect a significant difference (pre- to post-delivery Hb) between the two prophylactic regimens of 0.1 g/dL (SD 0.3 g/dL), and also adjusting for the cluster design, a total sample of approximately 1500 deliveries is planned(750 deliveries per group). Study Medications: Both the drugs and Uniject device will be obtained from a pharmaceutical company in compliance with good manufacturing procedures. Gynuity will be responsible for supplying and re-supplying both the medications throughout the study and will monitor all logistics related to supply. Ethical considerations: Both the drugs are safe, effective evidence-based prophylactic uterotonics to prevent PPH. However, the protocol will be approved by all relevant Institutional Review Boards prior to enrollment of study participants. Only authorized study personnel will have access to study supplies and documents. Monitoring and Evaluation: An independent data and safety monitoring board will review the data periodically and make recommendations to investigators concerning study modification, if needed.',\n",

       "  'A randomized, balanced, open label, crossover, two period, two treatment, two sequence, single dose, oral bioequivalence study under fasting condition. It is a pivotal study. To demonstrate the bioequivalence of Metformin 500 mg tablets manufactured by Savipharm J.S.C, Vietnam and Glucophage® 500 mg tablets of MERCK SANTE in healthy adult human male subjects under fasting condition and to monitor the safety of the study subjects.',\n",
       "  'Sample Size Estimation Assuming the formulation ratio (T/R) 95-105% and with the maximum observable intra subject variability for Metformin is 22% (based on literature), a sample size of 29 subjects would be sufficient to prove bioequivalence between the two formulations with power of at least 90%. Hence, total 32 subjects will be enrolled in the study considering withdrawal and dropouts. Hence, 32 healthy adult human male subjects will be enrolled. Adverse Events The investigator or site staff is responsible for detecting, documenting and reporting events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE. AEs will be collected from the start of Study Treatment and until the follow-up contact. Medical occurrences that begin prior to the start of study treatment but after obtaining informed consent may be recorded on the Medical History/Current Medical Conditions CRF. SAEs will be collected over the same time period as stated above for AEs. However, any SAEs assessed as related to study participation (e.g. study treatment, protocol-mandated procedures, invasive tests, or change in existing therapy) or related to a GSK concomitant medication will be recorded from the time a subject consents to participate in the study up to and including any follow-up contact. All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the sponsor within 24 hours. Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in former study participants. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a subject has been discharged from the study, and he considers the event reasonably related to the study treatment or study participation, the investigator would promptly notify the sponsor. All serious adverse events will be informed to the sponsor within 24 hrs and to the IEC within 7 working days. Any unexpected serious adverse event (SAE) occurring during a clinical trial should be communicated promptly (within 14 calendar days) by the Sponsor/CRO to the Licensing Authority. Any follow-up information on a previously reported SAE will also be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours. If the investigator does not have all information regarding an SAE, he/she will not wait to receive additional information before notifying the sponsor of the event and completing the appropriate data collection tool. The investigator will always provide an assessment of causality at the time of the initial report. Screening procedures: Demographic data, medical and medication histories, complete physical examination, height, weight and BMI as well as 12 lead ECG, chest X-ray [PA view], vital signs [blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate and oral temperature], hematology, biochemistry, HIV 1 & 2, Hepatitis B and C, RPR test for Syphilis and urine analysis will be done at screening. Urine drug screen, Liver chemistry test and breath alcohol test to be done prior to each check-in. Breath alcohol test to be done prior to each ambulatory visit blood collection. Liver chemistry test to be done at the end of each period. Housing: The study subjects will be housed at least 11 h prior to drug administration until after the 24 h blood sampling in each study period. The housing will be followed by one ambulatory visits [36.0 hr post dose] for each period. Washout: At least 7 days, but not exceeding 14 days between two dosing days. Treatment arms: Test: A single dose of Metformin 500 mg tablet manufactured by Savipharm J.S.C, Vietnam. Reference: A single dose of Glucophage® 500 mg tablet of Merck Sante, France Drug administration: As per the randomization schedule, one tablet of either test or reference product will be orally administered to each subject in each period in sitting posture, after an overnight fast of at least 10 h. To avoid hypoglycemic episodes, the investigational products will be administered with 240 mL of a 20% glucose solution in water, followed by 60 mL of the glucose solution administered every 15 min for up to 4 h after dosing. Subjects will be instructed not to chew or crush the tablet but should be swallowed. Compliance for dosing will be assessed by identification of subjects with subject ID card, identification of label on investigational product to confirm correct allocation of treatment and checking the oral cavity immediately after dosing. Restrictions: Subjects will remain in upright position [sitting or ambulatory] for two hours after dosing in each period except when clinically indicated to change the posture. The subjects will fast for at least 10 h prior to dosing and 4 h post-dose. Water will be permitted ad libitum except for 1 h before and until 1 h after post dose. During 1 hr post dose water restriction a, 60 mL of 20% glucose solution will be administered every 15 min to the study subjects. In each period of the study, 18 blood samples of 6 mL each will be collected in K2EDTA vacutainers via an indwelling catheter placed in one of the forearm veins. Heparin-lock technique will be used to prevent clotting of blood in the indwelling catheter. Before each in-house blood sample is drawn through catheter, 0.5 mL of blood will be discarded so as to purge the heparin containing blood sample in the catheter. Blood can also be collected by direct venipuncture in case of cannula blockage, during ambulatory visits or for any other practical reasons. The two pre-dose blood samples will be collected within a period of 1 h before the drug administration. The post-dose blood samples will be collected at 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 8.0, 10.0, 12.0, 16.0, 24.0 and 36.0 h. The 36.0 h post dose blood samples will be collected during ambulatory visits by direct venipuncture. Immediately after collection of blood, the sample will be kept in ice bath. After collecting the blood samples from all the subjects at each sampling time point, samples will be centrifuged at 4oC with 3500 rpm for 10 minutes. The plasma samples will be separated and stored in pre-labeled polypropylene tubes at -70 ± 10°C pending assay. The time interval between sample collection and the start of centrifugation should not exceed more than 45 minutes. The blood sample collection, processing and analysis will be done under sodium monochromatic light. The total volume of blood drawn including the volume necessary for the laboratory tests, PK sample analysis and the volume of blood discarded before each in house blood draw will be about 250 mL per subject for the entire study. Subjects monitoring: Brief physical examination and vital signs [blood pressure, pulse rate and oral temperature] will be carried out and recorded at each check-in and at check-out. Vital signs [blood pressure and pulse rate] will also be recorded before dosing of investigational products, between 2 - 3, 9 - 10 and 36.0 h post dose. Vital signs should be done in sitting position after rest of at least 5 minutes. Physical examination and measurement of vital signs can also be carried out at any time during the conduct of the study if the Investigator/Doctor feels it necessary. In case of abnormality in pre-dose vital signs, Investigator based on his medical judgement will take the decision whether to dose the subject or not. During vitals recording each subject will be asked about his well-being. Also subject well-being questionnaire will be performed at 1.0 and 5.0 h post dose. Post-study Procedures: Safety evaluation [complete physical examination, vital signs, hematology [except blood grouping & Rh typing] and biochemistry] will be done at the end of the clinical part of the study. In case of any withdrawals during the study safety assessment will be done at the time of withdrawal. In case of dropouts subjects will be asked to visit the facility to undergo safety assessments. Pharmacokinetic Parameters: Cmax, Tmax, AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, AUC%_Extrap, Kel and t1/2 Analytical Methods: Metformin in plasma will be estimated using validated LC-MS/MS method. Statistical Methods: Statistical analyses will be done using SAS® version 9.2 or higher. Analysis of variance [ANOVA] for log-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters [Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞], two one-sided tests [Schuirmann] for bioequivalence, power, ratio and 90% confidence interval for log-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters - Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ will be performed. Standards for Bioequivalence: The calculated 90% Confidence Interval for the test to reference ratio of Metformin should fall within the range of 80%-125% for log transformed Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ for the conclusion of bioequivalence.',\n",

       "  \"The increasing prevalence of diabetes, especially type 2 diabetes, combined with a steadily increasing proportion of older people in the population, will present enormous challenges for health care services in Norway. An epidemiologic study of diabetes-related foot ulcers among community-dwelling adults, including older people, based on data from the Nord-Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT2) showed that a history of foot ulcer was significantly associated with increased mortality and that about 10% of the people with diabetes reported a history of foot ulcer. Studies have shown that a foot ulcer is associated with reduced quality of life, social limitations and pain. Treating foot ulcers costs society considerable money. These results emphasize that diabetes-related foot ulcers represent a challenge for the individual and for health care services. Health care services need to rapidly begin treatment for people with diabetes-related foot ulcers to ensure high-quality treatment. Telemedicine innovations for health care services have developed considerably in recent decades. The National Health Plan for Norway (2007-2010) emphasizes that the use of information and communication technologies is an important way of achieving health policy aims in establishing more integrated diagnosis, treatment and care pathways across organizational boundaries. Qualitative studies of diabetes-related foot ulcers have shown that using telemedicine equipment enables follow-up care of similar quality to traditional consultations while enabling more flexible organization and greater patient satisfaction. A few minor quantitative studies show positive gains when telemedicine equipment is used in following up diabetes-related foot ulcers, but no randomized controlled studies have been performed in this field. Further, studies focusing on the more long-term effects are lacking. The project is in accordance with national guidelines and will contribute to increasing the focus on research related to integrated care. We expect this project to provide evidence about alternative care pathways with a holistic approach that could moderate increases in the cost of health care services by delivering a larger proportion of services in municipal primary care. The project will be able to provide new evidence on meeting the challenges of diabetes-related care more systematically and proactively. We expect that the results of this study will contribute to showing the extent to which treatment at the lowest effective service level will be more cost-effective and of good or better quality than traditional clinical follow-up. This study can and will contribute to setting priorities for the users' needs for flexible health services and enabling more patients to be treated near their homes. If the study finds evidence of positive health gains for the individual people with diabetes and contributes to high quality of care, this new model can be implemented in the entire Stavanger Hospital Trust. This approach will enable the multidisciplinary team in specialist health care to be used more appropriately, and the team will be more accessible for health care personnel in municipal primary health care. This model can be transferred to other hospital trusts and contribute to improving knowledge on diabetes among nurses in municipal primary health care.\",\n",

       "  'The ways in which influenza is transmitted between people are uncertain; for example, we do not know if large droplets or fine particles (aerosols) matter most; both are produced by coughing and sneezing. This means we cannot say what precautions work best in real life. Improving our understanding is vital to allow the development of guidelines and policies to help reduce the transmission of both pandemic and seasonal flu. The aim of this study is to explore how influenza is spread, specifically by looking at the importance of spread via small particles (aerosols/droplet nuclei) that are carried in respiratory sprays e.g. produced by coughing and sneezing. The primary objective of this study is: To estimate the contribution of aerosols/droplet nuclei to influenza transmission by determining the secondary attack rate (SAR) of influenza in Recipients randomised to a control arm (no intervention - allowing all modes of transmission) compared to Recipients randomised to an intervention arm (face shield and hand hygiene - allowing only transmission by aerosols/droplet nuclei) when both groups of Recipients are exposed to Donor volunteers infected with influenza via intranasal drops. The hypothesis is that: The SAR will be lower in Recipients exposed only to aerosols/droplet nuclei (intervention arm) compared to those exposed to all modes of transmission (the control arm): aerosols/droplet nuclei, droplet spray (larger respiratory droplets) and transmission through contact.',\n",
       "  'The study will take place in a quarantine facility. Some volunteers (Donors) will be infected with the influenza virus via droplets into the nose. Other volunteers (Recipients) will then be exposed to them by occupying the same room (in the day time) and taking part in certain activities e.g. playing card games. Some of the Recipients will wear face shields and clean their hands regularly during the times they are with the Donors. The wearing of face shields together with good hand hygiene should reduce the spread of infection through large respiratory droplets and contact with contaminated surfaces but will not prevent infection that occurs through aerosols in the air. Use of symptom diaries and diagnostic tests for influenza will allow the presence of subsequent illness to be identified. Volunteers will be required to participate in the quarantine facility for up to approximately 13 days (typically 9 for Donors and 13 days for Recipients), plus study screening clinics and followup. Additionally, during the study, environmental sampling will be performed looking for the presence of influenza virus. Air sampling and swabbing of surfaces and objects may provide information enabling us to better understand the routes of transmission.',\n",

       "  'Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the 2nd leading cause of cancer death in the US, though CRC death can be reduced by screening. However, there is uncertainty as to which screening strategy is most clinically and cost-effective from a population perspective where the aim is to optimize completion of the entire screening process continuum. Modeling studies suggest benefits and harms of colonoscopy and stool blood test strategies are similar, but generally assume 100% participation and subsequent clinically appropriate follow up--something never achieved in clinical practice. Comparative effectiveness studies of testing strategies, including comparisons of specific tests and approaches to optimizing effective test use, are necessary. Safety-net health systems care for populations at increased risk for adverse CRC outcomes, such as the uninsured and minorities, and have more limited resources. Therefore, safety-nets must resolve the uncertainty regarding the most effective screening strategy. The investigators will conduct a system-level, randomized comparative effectiveness trial of the benefits, harms, and costs of 3 screening strategies over 3 years, among 6000 patients age 50-64 years, who are not up-to-date with CRC screening, served by a large safety net health system. The three strategies studied will be: 1) Fecal immunochemical testing, with annual mailed invitation outreach (including a test kit), and a centralized process to promote participation and complete clinical follow up (FIT); 2) Colonoscopy, with annual mailed invitation outreach, and a centralized process to promote participation and complete clinical follow up (Colo); 3) Usual Care, with no mailed invitation outreach, and screening offered at primary care visits. The primary measure of benefit will be an outcome measure that summarizes patient-specific effective screening successes. The primary measure of harm will be screening non-participation. The primary measure of cost will be cost per-patient effectively screened. Our specific aims are to: 1) Compare benefits, harms, and costs of a FIT strategy versus a Colo strategy for CRC screening among patients not up-to-date with screening, and 2) Compare benefits, harms, and costs of a) the FIT strategy vs. Usual Care and b) the Colo strategy vs. Usual Care for CRC screening.',\n",

       "  'Among people diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, the widespread use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has greatly improved survival rates and changed the leading causes of death, from AIDS-related diseases to cardiovascular disease and lung cancer. Rates of tobacco use among individuals with HIV/AIDS are very high and varenicline may be particularly efficacious for treating nicotine dependence among individuals with HIV/AIDS. Through this trial, 310 smokers with HIV/AIDS will be randomized to varenicline plus 9 weeks of smoking cessation counseling or placebo plus 9 weeks of smoking cessation counseling. The investigators hypothesize that 1) varenicline and counseling will significantly increase end-of-treatment (week 12) and 24-week biochemically-confirmed abstinence, versus placebo and counseling; 2) quality of life will be rated higher in the varenicline and counseling group versus the placebo and counseling group, and there will be no significant differences between treatment arms in terms of the frequency of severe varenicline-related side effects; and 3) improved affect and reduced cognitive impairment will mediate the effect of varenicline therapy on quit rates.',\n",
       "  \"Among people diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, the widespread use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has greatly improved survival rates and changed the leading causes of death, from AIDS-related diseases (e.g., non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Kaposi sarcoma), to cardiovascular disease and lung cancer. As such, addressing modifiable risk factors for disease mortality among those with HIV/AIDS, including tobacco use, has become a critical priority. To date, only three smoking cessation clinical trials have been conducted with those with HIV/AIDS none of which investigated the efficacy of FDA-approved medications for nicotine dependence. Varenicline is an α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor partial agonist with greater efficacy for treating nicotine dependence than bupropion or nicotine patch. Varenicline may be particularly efficacious for treating nicotine dependence among individuals with HIV/AIDS given that depression symptoms and cognitive impairment are common in this population, increase during smoking abstinence and predict smoking relapse, and are significantly reduced by varenicline. Therefore, the investigators will conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of varenicline with smokers with HIV/AIDS. Specifically, 310 smokers with HIV/AIDS will be randomized to varenicline plus 9 weeks of smoking cessation counseling or placebo plus 9 weeks of smoking cessation counseling. The primary outcome variable for this study will be 7-day biochemically confirmed tobacco abstinence at weeks 12 and 24. Secondary outcomes include: prolonged abstinence to week 12, 18, and 24 (relapse defined as 7 consecutive days of self-reported smoking, after a 2-week grace period), continuous abstinence at weeks 12 and 24 (e.g., no smoking between quit day and follow-up), time to 7-day relapse (no grace period), and lapse and recovery events. The trial results may support the use of varenicline for the treatment of nicotine dependence among those with HIV/AIDS, thereby reducing tobacco-related morbidity and mortality in this population.\",\n",

       "  \"Barriers to healthy eating and active living are at the heart of the obesity epidemic. This study focuses on a key factor underlying healthy eating: home food preparation. Preparing food at home entails a sequence of steps from obtaining food, to planning and cooking or preparing meals, to finally serving and eating the meal. Many strategies to curb obesity in children focus on eliminating processed and fast food from the diet, as well as improving access to fresh produce and other healthy ingredients. A collective ability to regularly and reliably prepare healthy food at home is implicit in these and other prevention strategies. Little research, however, has grappled with the phenomenon that there has been a generational loss of home food preparation ability over the past few decades. What is urgently needed is to design effective, enticing, and scalable interventions to improve home food preparation practices across diverse groups. This study aims to test the effectiveness of a community-located, peer mentored intervention to improve home food preparation practices in families with young children. The investigators will partner with Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Early Head Start, a community-based organization serving families with children ages 0 to 3 years in West Philadelphia, aiming specifically to: 1. Use the principles of Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) to design, evaluate and disseminate a peer mentored intervention aimed at improving home food preparation practices among families with young children. 2. Conduct a randomized controlled trial with a delayed entry control group to test the effect of the intervention on three outcomes: home food preparation practices, healthfulness of the diet, and cooking-related self-efficacy. The investigators hypothesize that families participating in this intervention will demonstrate improvement in parental self-efficacy related to cooking, home food preparation practices, and the healthfulness of parents' and toddlers' diets post-intervention, compared to families who do not participate in the intervention.\",\n",

       "  'The aim of this study is to determine the effects of a low dosage of prophylactic haloperidol in patients with a high risk to develop delirium, defined by an expected ICU length of stay of >1 day. The investigators hypothesized that haloperidol prophylaxis in patients with a high risk for delirium reduces 28-day mortality, delirium and delirium related outcome. Two different dosages of haloperidol are used in this study to compare with placebo. A dosage of 1mg, or 2mg or placebo three times a day in a double-blinded fashion resulting in a three-armed multicentre randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trial. To relate the potential beneficial effects of haloperidol to the a priori risk to develop delirium, the PREDELIRIC-model (delirium prediction model for ICU patients) will be used. This will enable the investigators to determine the preventive efficacy of haloperidol in patient groups based on their risk to develop delirium.',\n",
       "  'In this study high risk patients will be included. Based on historical data the investigators know that the median predicted delirium risk is 35% in patients with an expected stay on the ICU of over one day. This is considered a high risk to develop delirium. To assess patients for delirium using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM)-ICU is part of daily clinical practice in all participating centres. In this study, high risk patients will receive three times a day a study drug of which two groups receive a low dose of haloperidol (1mg or 2mg) and a third arm will receive placebo. This drug is worldwide the first choice of drug to treat delirious patients. When delirium is diagnosed, patients are treated according to delirium protocol, using a higher dosage than in the prophylactic treatment period as described in the study protocol. It is recognized that early treatment of delirium has beneficial effects compared with delayed treatment, and there is also some evidence that delirium prevention in ICU patients has beneficial effects, but the design of these previous studies was not optimal. Potential side-effects of haloperidol include, extrapyramidal symptoms, drowsiness, agitation, and ventricular arrhythmias. The latter are extremely rare (only case-reports are published) and related to a higher dosage of haloperidol. With the dosage that will be used in the present study no relevant side-effects are anticipated. Nevertheless, and given the preventive nature of this study, extra attention is being paid on recognition of possible side-effects of haloperidol in the protocol. Importantly, in three recent prophylactic haloperidol studies no relevant side-effects, and in particular no ventricular arrhythmias, were reported using a similar low dosage of haloperidol as described in the present protocol. During the study several inter-rater reliability checks (delirium experts versus ICU nurses) concerning the CAM_ICU assessments will be performed. Also medical and nursing files will be checked to secure the quality of the delirium diagnose. The study will be monitored (all sites), randomly included patient data will be checked on delirium diagnose and endpoints of the study. All data will be collected by Electronic CRF. A check of completeness on all data is build-in. All variables are defined using a data dictionary (using the NICE data dictionary) supplemented with definitions of PREDELIRIC-model predictors, delirium diagnosis (at least one positive CAM-ICU assessment), and delirium duration. Sample size calculation is based on the effect on number of days of survival in 28-days mortality derived from the evaluation study using low dosage of prophylactic haloperidol. If the true hazard ratio of control patients relative to intervention patients is 0.85, taken into account an accrual time of 90 days with 28 days of follow-up, the investigators will need to study 647 patients per intervention group and 647 control patients to be able to reject the null hypothesis that the experimental and control survival curves are equal with probability (power) 0.80. The Type I error probability associated with this test of this null hypothesis is 0.05. Taken into account a drop out of 10% the investigators will include 715 patients per group; in total 2145 patients. The investigators assume that the effect on number of days of survival in 28-days mortality will be comparable between the two intervention groups. The Cox-regression analysis group will have three levels (placebo, 1 mg and 2 mg haloperidol three times daily). A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)will monitor the safety of the study including interim analyses on safety/futility after 175-350 and 500 patients and safety and superiority after 1000 patients. Followed by a final analysis after 2145 patients.

Methods/Subjects: Healthy female subjects will be screened for low iron status. Anemic subjects will be excluded from the study. Thirty two subjects will be included with serum ferritin <20 µg/L, C-reactive protein <5 mg/L and Hemoglobin >117 g/L. Subjects will be randomized in two groups and their Hepcidin (sHep) and iron status markers monitored at day 1 (baseline). Subjects will receive iron supplement dosages of 40, 80, 160 and 240 mg in either single or as two consecutive dosages with stable iron isotopes 54Fe, 57Fe, 58Fe in form of 4 mg of iron sulfate (FeSO4). Prior administration blood samples will be collected at 8:00, 12:00 and 16:00 to monitor sHep and iron status markers, these measurements will be repeated on the days of supplement administration. On the following days, sHep will be measured at 8:00 to quantify the duration of the iron induced hepcidin rise. In the second week, subjects receiving a single Fe dose on week 1 will receive two consecutive dosages and vice versa, while the same sampling scheme as in week one will be applied. On day 23, a last blood sample will be collected and iron incorporation of stable isotopic labels will be measured from the different dosages administered. Outcome: The combined use of stable iron isotopes and a sensitive SHep assay will allow for better understanding of the iron-hepcidin relationship and this may enable design of more effective OIS regimens.',\n",

       "  \"The worldwide estimated annual incidence of SCI has a broad spectrum, ranging from 236 to 1009 cases per million of people. In Mexico there is an estimate of 18.1 cases per million people, affecting primary men in their productive age (25-34 years old). Most of the patients have disabilities after the injury, and become dependent of their families or professional care providers. The cornerstone treatment in the long therm is rehabilitation and the main goal is to achieve patient independence. Over the last two decades many disability measure instruments have been developed, like the Functional Interdisciplinary Measure (FIM). This scale though it is very useful for patients' general outcome, it does not grade patients' independence entirely. In 1997, Dr. Amiram Catz developed the first version of the Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM). Since its first version, it showed to be a very powerful tool to assess patients' independence. Recently, the SCIM-III has been validated in a multicenter study, showing validity, reliability and internal consistency. The aim of this study is to perform a translate and trans-cultural adaptation of the SCIM-III into Spanish and to perform also its validation in Mexican population.\",\n",

Body postures during sleep influence the severity of sleep-disordered breathing because a supine position is associated with an increase in upper airway collapsibility and thus an increase in frequency and duration of snoring and apnea. Use of an adjustable bed to elevate patients' head might improve those conditions. The purpose of the present study is to determine whether use of an automatic adjustable bed is associated with reducing sleep-disordered breathing in patients with suspected obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) due to upper airway problems.\",\n",
       "  'From the Chest and Otorhinolaryngology Department, patients with symptomatic sleep-disordered breathing will be referred to the Sleep Center. After an interview these subjects will undergo a full-night polysomnography (PSG). Patients who are eligible for this study will sleep on an automatic adjustable bed with a second PSG performed within the next one month. The automatic device is initiated when the patient suffers from apnea ≥ 10 seconds, which is detected by an ultra-wideband (UWB) sensor placed under the bed. The head will be slightly elevated at an angle of 10 degrees lasting 10 seconds and then be put down softly. Parameters of sleep efficiency and architecture, apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), and oxygen saturation will be obtained during each PSG. According to the severity, enrolled patients will be classified into 4 groups as normal (AHI < 5), mild OSA (AHI between 5 and 15), moderate OSA (AHI between 15 and 30) and severe OSA (AHI > 30).

       "  'Background Information and Rationale: Trastuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that acts extracellularly on the erbB-2 receptor.Trastuzumab is a recombinant humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody against the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/erbB-2),which has shown in both in vitro assays and in animals, to inhibit the proliferation of human tumour cells that overexpress erbB-2. Additionally, trastuzumab is a potent mediator of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). In vitro, trastuzumab-mediated ADCC has been shown to be preferentially exerted on erbB-2 overexpressing cancer cells compared with cancer cells that do not overexpress erbB-2. Trastuzumab has emerged as a widely accepted standard of care for erbB-2-positive disease. (Metastatic/ adjuvant/neoadjuvant. Our current hypothesis suggests that the cells which are disseminated at the time of surgery will encounter an inhospitable environment which will be anti-HER in nature. Therefore combining the above mentioned streams of thought, we would like to assess the effect of a short pre-operative course of Trastuzumab on breast cancer relapse. The study is proposed in HER2 positive patients with operable breast cancer. Objectives : Primary: The primary objective of the study is to see the effect of short duration of peri-operative Trastuzumab on disease-free survival in comparison in all patients Secondary: The safety of the pre-operative therapies including the early post operative morbidity 1. Overall survival (OS) in all patients and in pathologically node positive patients. 2. The level of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the peripheral blood assessed before starting pre-operative therapy and at the same time point in the control arm, level of CTCs 10 minutes prior to start of surgery, during surgery and 10 days after surgery on 40 consecutive consenting patients (20 in each arm). The levels of circulating chromatin will also be estimated at the same time points as CTC for these 40 patients. 3. Evaluation of the paraffin blocks for pTEN loss6-8 and p95ErbB2 truncated form of HER2 on 100 consecutive consenting patients (50 in each arm).9-11 Study Design : This is phase 3, randomized Double blinded parallel group study of Trastuzumab in pre operative setting in operable breast cancer patients. Approximately 1000 patients with Women with HER2neu positive, T1/T2/T3 and N0/N1. clinical T4 and/or N2 disease who are considered operable by the treating surgeon with histopathological diagnosis on core biopsies, will be included in the study.

Progesterone 500 mg deep IM 4 -14 days prior to surgery Patients will be stratified, before randomization for Tumor size, menopausal status, and affordability for Trastuzumab and centre of the study. These patients will then be randomized 1:1 to receive the following Intervention arm: .A single dose of Trastuzumab (Herceptin, Hoffman La Roche) at 8 mg/Kg as a 90 minute intravenous infusion in 250 ml of normal saline, in the window period of 10-15 4 to 14 days (both days inclusive) prior to the planned date of surgery. Control arm: A 90 minute intravenous infusion of saline as placebo All patients will thereafter receive standard post-operative adjuvant therapy as per local institutional practice including hormonal therapy, chemotherapy and radiation therapy.',\n",

       "  'The CUSA (cavitron ultrasound surgical aspirator) is the method of choice for hepatic resection in our center. Recently a stapler-hepatectomy methods has been developed and approved for liver surgery using Covidien Endo-Gia stapler. The potential benefit of this method is a potential shorter transection time compared to the CUSA technique. Thus the investigators will perform a randomized controlled trial including 20 patients in the stapler-group and 20 patients in the CUSA control group. Primary endpoint will be transection speed. Secondary endpoints will be peri-operative (d-1, d0, d1, d3) cytokines concentration, T cell subsets, blood loss, morbidity, and a cost analysis.',\n",
       "  'Many different techniques of parenchymal transection are used in hepatic surgery. In a systematic review, there were no significant differences in morbidity (including bile leak), mortality, routine markers of liver parenchymal injury or dysfunction and length of hospital stay irrespective of the method used for parenchymal transection. This Cochrane review analyzed studies comparing the following transection devices: CUSA (cavitron ultrasound surgical aspirator) versus clamp-crush (two trials); radiofrequency dissecting sealer versus clamp-crush (two trials); sharp dissection versus clamp-crush technique (one trial); and hydrojet versus CUSA (one trial). The clamp-crush technique appeared to have the lowest blood loss and lowest transfusion requirements compared to the other techniques. However, even in specialized centers morbidity and mortality rates of hepatic resections are still in the range of 45% and 3% respectively and uncertainty persists regarding the optimal technique of transection. Local experience seems to be the most important factor for the choice of the transection method. An innovative technique is stapler hepatectomy using Covidien Endo-Gia™ Ultra Handle Short Staplers and Endo Gia™ TRI staple 60mm or 45 mm AVM/AMT loading units (Covidien). A randomized controlled trial (CRUNSH trial) to evaluate the intraoperative blood loss of stapler hepatectomy compared to the clamp-crushing technique is currently under way. The CUSA technique is well established in many centers including ours with excellent morbidity and mortality rates. However, it has been shown that CUSA has a longer transection speed than the clamp-crush technique (with vascular occlusion). The investigators of the CRUNSH trial hypothesize that stapler hepatectomy technique might also be comparable or more favorable to clamp-crushing regarding transection time with the advantage of avoiding vascular occlusion. Therefore stapler hepatectomy should also be faster than CUSA. It has been shown that the release of cytokines, chemokines, and stress hormones correlates with postoperative infection and organ dysfunction. Chemokines are critically involved in the process of leukocyte recruitment and activation in the liver. Major surgery causes inflammation reflected in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In various studies IL-6, for instance, was a valid predictor for post-operative sepsis, complications or mortality. Besides, the levels of these cytokines are expected to correlate with the degree of surgical trauma. Therefore differences in cytokine levels between the two study groups will be assessed, including pro- (INF-γ, IL-1β, IL-5, IL-6, IL12p70, TNFα) and anti-inflammatory (IL-4, IL-10, IL-13) cytokines. Monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) production is elevated in Kupffer cells following ischemia / reperfusion in response to free radicals and neutrophil elastase, as well as in animal oxidative liver injury models (e.g. carbon tetrachloride) Macrophage inflammatory protein-3-alpha (MIP3-alpha) is constitutively expressed in the liver. It is strongly chemotactic for cytokine-stimulated neutrophils, immature dendritic cells and memory/effector T and B lymphocytes by utilizing chemokine receptor (CCR) 6. sCD163 (soluble haemoglobin scavenger receptor) is a novel marker of activated macrophages, like neopterin it can be determined in serum or plasma. The effect of the transection speed in respect to chemokine release has never been investigated. The investigators hypothesize that a shorter transection time leads to a reduced release of these molecules potentially resulting in improved postoperative outcome. Additionally the interaction between adaptive and innate immunity plays a significant role in liver ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Notably, activation of T cells in the absence of TCR ligation seems to be a predominant factor in the initial phase of I/R injury. Therefore as a pilot study, peripheral T cell subsets (including naïve T cells, effector and central memory T cells, regulatory T cells, early activated T cells) will be determined by flow cytometry in a subgroup of study patients (i.e. patients undergoing hepatic resection for other than oncological reasons). The supposedly slower technique of CUSA resection shall therefore be compared with the novel technique of stapler hepatectomy.',\n",

Investigators are looking to determine if in two hours infants who weighed less than 1500 grams or 3 pounds 5 ounces, will demonstrate a decrease in the amount of carbon dioxide (the gas that humans exhale) dissolved in their blood as compared to prior to starting the study. This will be accomplished by enrolling infants who are stable on their current type of mechanical breathing that provides a constant air flow into the infant. This type of mechanical support helps keep the lungs inflated but does not help remove carbon dioxide. This study will change the type of mechanical support to a type of support called neurally adjusted ventilatory assist or NAVA. This type of mechanical support detects when the infant is breathing in by having electrical sensors on a feeding tube that is placed into the stomach through the nose or mouth. These electrical sensors detect when the diaphragm or the muscle that helps humans breath is trying to take a breath in. When the NAVA ventilator senses the attempt to breath, it provides additional air flow to make the effort of breathing easier. The ventilator will be attached to a tube or cannula that is placed into the infant's nose. After two hours of being on the NAVA ventilator a repeat measure of carbon dioxide in the blood will be performed by taking a small amount of blood from the infant's heel.\",\n",

Traditionally, early mobilization has been reserved for patients treated surgically and this may have unintentionally skewed treatment results. The investigators have therefore designed a prospective randomized trial performed as collaboration between Akershus University Hospital (Ahus), Oslo University Hospital (The Emergency Department), Østfold Hospital (Fredrikstad) and Drammen Hospital. The four institutions were chosen because of their geographical proximity and because they jointly have a substantial catchment area. Treatment is divided into three arms, and patients between 18 and 60 years of age sustaining first time achilles tendon ruptures will be invited to participate.',\n",
       "  'Patients are randomized to either surgery or non-operative treatment. Surgery will be performed by open technique or by using a mini-invasive approach. Open surgery remains widespread and arguably the best documented treatment, however mini-invasive surgery is also included because of its potential to lessen the risk of wound complications. Michael Amlang and Hans Zwipp at the University of Dresden represent some of the leading foot- and ankle surgeons in Europe. They and their co-workers have developed a protocol for mini-invasive surgery using specially adapted proprietary instruments. Michael Amlang visited Ahus in 2012 teaching the general principles of the Dresden mini-invasive treatment. To ensure optimal and reproducible results, surgeons participating in the study must master both techniques. All patients included in the study will be immobilized in equinus position for the first two weeks using a below-the-knee cast. Following the first two weeks the cast is replaced with a brace maintaining ∼12° plantar flexion (three heel lifts). We have chosen to use standardized heel lifts because it eases weightbearing compared to a hinged brace. After two weeks (four weeks from injury) the ankle position is adjusted to ∼8° plantar flexion (two heel lifts) and following additional two weeks the ankle position is adjusted to ∼4° plantar flexion (one heel lift). The last week of the orthosis treatment the heel lift is completely removed. Hence, the brace is retained for a total of six weeks, and patients are allowed full weight bearing as tolerated during the entire time period. The brace is worn day and night for the first two weeks, but is removed during nighttime for the last four weeks. Importantly, the immobilization regimen is identical for all three-treatment groups. To ensure identical rehabilitation following immobilization, physical therapy has to adhere to a standardized protocol supervised by an experienced physiotherapist at the Norwegian Sport Medicine Clinic (NIMI). The defined endpoint is treatment results evaluated by the Achilles tendon Total Rupture Score (ATRS). This is a patient-centered self-reporting instrument with good reliability, validity and sensitivity. Furthermore, ATRS will be combined with SF36, another commonly used self-reporting instrument. Pain is evaluated by a visual analogue scale (VAS). Functional results are evaluated by The MuscleLab measurement system (Ergotest Innovation, Porsgrunn, Norway). The system consists of two different jump tests (drop counter-movement jump and hopping), two different strength tests (concentric heel rise and eccentric-concentric heel rise) and one muscular endurance test (standing heel rise) and the system has been shown to be both valid and reliable assessing lower leg function in patients with Achilles tendinopathy. We will also measure dorsiflexion and plantarflexion range of movement (ROM) as well as the circumference of the calf, all widely used endpoints in similar studies. Secondly, we want to compare the risk of complications such as infections and reruptures. The patients are examined at baseline and after 6 and 12 months. Since there are only minor functional improvements after 12 months, we do not plan any later follow-up as part of the main project. The 6 and 12 months examinations will be completed at the Norwegian Sport Medicine Clinic (NIMI), these examinations are blinded and performed by two physiotherapists who have not been taking part in the study prior to final follow-up. Patients will be wearing knee socks to hide potential scar tissue. Although the minimum clinically important difference in ATRS score has yet to be determined, Carmont and coworkers have shown that 7 points represent the smallest detectable change. Moreover, a study by Metz et al. found that patients with reruptures of the achilles tendon presented on average 18 points lower scores whereas patients with injuries of the sural nerve or superficial wound infections presented scores 10 and 9 points lower than average, respectively. In order to detect a difference of 7 points in ATRS score with 80% power there must be 160 patients in each group. Power calculations are based on one-way ANOVA analyses assuming a common standard deviation of 20. This concomitantly allows us to detect differences as low as 8 % with respect to complications. This is of pivotal importance since assessing the risk of reruptures is essential when establishing treatment recommendations. We therefore plan to include a total of 530 patients allowing for expected loss during follow-up. Ahus, The Emergency Department of Oslo University Hospital, Drammen and Fredrikstad Hospitals have a catchment area of nearly 1.3 million people and treats in excess of 300 achilles tendon ruptures annually. This allows for completion of the inclusion period within three years. In our view, this is the first study to include a sufficient number of patients to detect lesser, but yet important differences, and the results will be published in a suitable international peer-reviewed journal. The prospective randomized trial embodies many different disciplines and will spur off follow-up studies. As part of the main project we will conduct a treatment-cost analysis in relation to individual results. We will also perform an investigation based on ultrasound grading of Achilles tendon ruptures according to a classification system established by Michael Amlang and colleagues. Previous studies have provided evidence suggesting that treatment results may depend on the extension of the injury, and that treatment recommendations should be based on type of rupture sustained. This is of particular interest as it may facilitate individualized treatment. Together with the prospective randomized trial and the treatment-cost analysis, the ultrasound investigation will constitute the core of the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) project.',\n",

       "  '70% of breast cancers that occur in postmenopausal women rely on the hormone oestrogen to grow and are likely to respond to hormone treatment. This type of treatment reduces the amount of oestrogen in the body, slowing the growth of cancer or stopping it altogether. One type of hormone treatment, aromatase inhibitors (AIs), works by stopping the body from making oestrogen. Currently, women with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer that is not being controlled by one class of AI are switched to the other class of AI. The reason for this is that some cancer cells can become resistant to one class but are still sensitive to the other class. However, oestrogen can be made in the body by two pathways and AIs block only one of these pathways. A new drug called Irosustat can reduce the production of oestrogen in the body by blocking the second pathway. This study is investigating whether adding Irosustat to AI treatment i.e. blocking both pathways at the same time, can further reduce the amount of oestrogen in the body and therefore control the breast cancer better. 27 postmenopausal women with oestrogen receptor positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer that is not being controlled by their current AI treatment will be recruited in this study from 9 United Kingdom (UK) hospitals. Eligible patients will receive 40mg of Irosustat once daily in addition to the AI on which they progressed. Patients will receive Irosustat for as long as it controls their cancer or until they have side effects that stop them from taking treatment. Patients will be seen monthly for the first 6 months and every 3 months thereafter. Participating patients will also be given the option to take part in the exploratory part of this study by donating tissue and blood samples.',\n",

       "  'Sarcosine (also called N-methylglycine) is an endogenous GlyT-1 inhibitor. By blocking glycine uptake, sarcosine increases synaptic glycine concentration to enhance NMDA receptor function. NMDA receptor, a subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptors, serves important functions in the brain, including learning, memory, cognition, and neural plasticity under physiological conditions and contributes to neurodegeneration in pathophysiological processes. NMDA receptor represents collectively a group of heteromeric tetramers. Every NMDA receptor is a protein complex, typically composed of two NR1 subunits and two NR2 subunits that together form the NMDA receptor ion channel. It requires two receptor agonists (glutamate for the NR2 binding site and glycine for the NR1 binding site) to open the ion channel for NMDA receptor activation. Clinically, modulation through the NMDA-NR1-glycine site is preferred to avoid the excitotoxicity associated with the glutamate site activation.8 In addition, recent animal studies have shown that dopamine secretion can be enhanced by either blocking the striatal NR2 or by activation of the NMDA-receptor glycine site. In the project, we will focus on pharmacological enhancement of NMDA-glycine receptor function based on increasing synaptic glycine concentration by sarcosine administration to examine whether enhancing NMDA-glycine receptor activity can improve the neuropsychiatric symptoms, cognition and hopefully motor function in PD-D patients',\n",

       "  'Hyper-reactive malarious splenomegaly (HMS) is a known chronic autoimmune complication in areas where malaria is endemic. Patients with HMS complain most commonly of abdominal swelling or pain from the enlarged spleen and the condition is defined using clear clinical and laboratory criteria. HMS appears benign in most patients when seen first but if untreated, it leads to severe anaemia and also acute bacterial infections. There is familiar and ethnic clustering suggesting genetic basis. High prevalence rates have been reported in certain areas of Papua New Guinea, and Venezuela, and HMS is also common in parts of sub-Saharan Africa, including Sudan and Ghana. The treatment of HMS is still empirical since no randomized trials have been done so far. Long term anti-malarial chemoprophylaxis is deemed the mainstay of therapy, but the optimal drug-regimen and duration are unknown. Three to six months may pass before a response is observed, and relapses may occur when therapy is discontinued. On the basis of the observed benefit in experimental studies, glucocorticoids have been used for severe hyper-reactive malarial splenomegaly in various case reports. Because these cases had a favourable outcome and the drug tolerability was good, prednisone has become an attractive therapeutic option for this disease. Central to the pathophysiology of HMS is the overproduction of Immunoglobulin M due to a functional CD8 T-cell defect and the consequent expansion and activation of B lymphocytes. Glucocorticoids may have an immediate effect due to inhibition of the sequestration of immunoglobulin coated red blood cells by the mononuclear phagocyte system and a later effect due to glucocorticoid-induced inhibition of antibody synthesis. We aim to assess the efficacy of chloroquine after prednisone-induction therapy compared to chloroquine alone in the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed hyper-reactive malarial splenomegaly.',\n",

       "  'The inhaled route of delivery has always been associated with the considerable challenge of getting the drug to its target. The lungs are a highly complex organ designed to filter inspired air, with many different cell types contributing to their function. Furthermore, the lungs may change dramatically when afflicted by disease resulting in an internal environment that works against the drug reaching and interacting successfully with the target. For targets in the upper airways this will have lesser significance, but drug delivery to the deep lung may be impeded by changes such as mucus hyper-secretion or thickening or airway narrowing. In order to interpret toxicology findings it is necessary to reconcile test sensitivity, background biological variation, normal responses to inhaled materials and drug or medicine-specific adverse effects. Identification of adverse end-points is an area where better control data sets might help discern true adverse effects from a normal physiological lung response. The lung responds acutely to inhalation of irritant materials by hyper-secretion of mucus, chemokine release, inflammatory cell recruitment and cough and collectively these may be characterized as non-specific irritancy.',\n",

       "  'Total shoulder surgeries are associated with considerable postoperative pain which may prevent rehabilitation and early discharge from the hospital. Continuous interscalene blocks with home infusions are commonly performed for pain relief following total shoulder arthroplasties. We want to evaluate the time to readiness for discharge following interscalene blocks in patients undergoing total shoulder arthroplasties.',\n",
       "  'The number of shoulder replacement surgeries is increasing over the years and it is expected to continue as the population ages (1). This necessitates adequate pain control in the immediate and early postoperative period when pain levels are typically high. Adequate analgesia ensures patient comfort and the ability to perform physical therapy exercises associated with positive surgical outcomes (2-3). Interscalene brachial plexus block (ISB) is commonly performed to provide analgesia for patients undergoing surgical procedures in the shoulder region. Either single injection blocks or continuous perineural infusions are performed along with oral medications for better pain control in these patients. Compared with intravenous opioids, ISB is known to produce superior analgesia after major shoulder surgery (4,5). There are reports of outpatient TSA discharged directly from the recovery room following the use of continuous ISB but achievement of adequate range of motion were not tested in them (6). Consequently, ambulatory ISB may offer decreased hospitalization while ensuring adequate analgesia after TSA. Ilfeld et al (7) prospectively compared ISB and opioids regarding the time to readiness for discharge following TSA, which was followed by many other studies demonstrating the safety and efficacy of continuous ISB for TSA (8, 9). Ilfeld et al (6) showed that discharge criteria were 21 (16-41) h with the use of ISB as compared to 51 (37-90) h for those receiving perineural normal saline. In our centre, healthy patients requiring shoulder arthroplasty usually remain as in-patients for management of pain. Perineural infusions may be continued at home using a portable infusion pump after discharge. With the use of disposable portable infusion pump for continuous ISB, it may be feasible to discharge patients and reduce hospitalization time. Although the study by Ilfeld et al showed continuous ISB allowing earlier home discharge following TSA, the patients in the study were evaluated for readiness to discharge on POD1 at 10 AM rather than the earliest times possible. Another interesting finding is that all patients received ropivacaine infusions till 6 AM of POD1 but the authors also claim to have discharged few patients on the same afternoon after the surgery. The block infusions reported in previous studies are higher than used at our institute. There is also conflicting evidence that although continuous ISB provides adequate analgesia, they seldom impact early functional rehabilitation (10). With this background we want to evaluate the earliest times for the achievement of readiness to discharge with the use of ISB following TSA.',\n",

Hypothesis: An integrated management protocol for MAM and SAM will achieve greater community coverage and a greater individual recovery rate than standard care.',\n",
       "  \"Specific Aim 1: Implement an integrated protocol in Sierra Leone for the management of MAM and non-complicated SAM that uses a single anthropometric indicator as well as the same food. Standard care refers to traditional, segregated treatment of MAM and SAM. Hypothesis: An integrated management protocol for MAM and SAM will achieve greater community coverage and a greater individual recovery rate than standard care. Methods Eligible subjects will be children with MAM or non-complicated SAM aged 6-59 months. MAM is defined as MUAC < 12.5 cm, but ≥ 11.5 cm. Non-complicated SAM will be defined as MUAC < 11.5 cm, or + or ++ bilateral edema, and having an acceptable appetite. An acceptable appetite will be judged by giving the child 30 g of RUTF and asking the mother to feed this food to the child over 20 minutes. Children with SAM who are able to consume this RUTF will be eligible for the study. Children unable to consume the RUTF or presenting with IMCI warning signs (convulsions, altered mental status, respiratory distress) will be considered to have complicated SAM and will be referred for inpatient treatment. Only the youngest child with malnutrition in each household will be enrolled; older siblings will be treated operationally using the same protocol. Exclusion criteria include children with obvious chronic debilitating illness like cerebral palsy or congenital abnormalities, or having received treatment for MAM or SAM in the previous two months. If any child needs immediate medical care s/he will be offered treatment or transport to the nearest health center, and not enrolled. Informed consent will be sought from the caretakers of all eligible children by a nurse familiar with the study and fluent in the caretaker's native language. Duration of the study and participation requirements will be explained. Informed consent will be given verbally and in writing. Study design This is a cluster randomized, unblinded, clinical controlled trial conducted in children comparing integrated treatment of SAM and MAM with standard treatment. The primary outcomes will be treatment coverage and recovery rate. The very obvious differences in integrated and standard care makes subject and staff blinding impossible. Ten study sites in rural and peri-urban Sierra Leone, where treatment for SAM and MAM is currently offered, will be selected by the Ministry of Health and Sanitation National Nutrition Program Sierra Leone and the PI for the study. Site managers will be consulted and their cooperation will be solicited prior to definitively selecting sites. The minimum sample size will be 900 children with MAM and 900 with SAM, 450 receiving integrated care and 450 receiving standard care in each group. Assuming that recovery rate is 75%, this sample size will detect an improvement in the recovery rate to 80% on the integrated protocol, with 95% specificity and 82% power. Participation Integrated Protocol Upon enrollment demographic information will be collected, weight, height and MUAC will be measured, simple health history obtained, and children will be assessed for edema. Information will be recorded on a standard data collection card. Enough RUTF will be dispensed for 2 weeks of therapy, and children will be asked to return for follow-up every 2 weeks. Children with SAM will initially be given oral amoxicillin twice daily for a week and asked to return for follow-up every 2 weeks. Once children with SAM achieve MUAC >11.5 cm, the RUTF dose will be reduced. Upon follow-up, caretakers of children will be questioned about symptoms of acute illness, compliance with study foods and food intolerance or allergy. If edema persists or MUAC is ≤ 12.5 cm, an additional two weeks of RUTF will be dispensed. If the child is judged to have altered mental status, respiratory distress or an acute clinical illness needing medical care, the child will be referred to the health center for complicated SAM and withdrawn. If MUAC > 12.5 cm, the child will be given lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNS), a bed net, albendazole, zinc, referral for immunizations compliant with current WHO recommendations, oral rehydration salts to give if the child has more than three loose watery stools in 24 hours, and asked to return for follow-up in 1, 3 and 6 months. Caretakers will be instructed to seek medical care sooner if the child has fever, poor appetite or signs of an acute illness. If the child is between 6-24 months of age, the caretaker will participate in enhanced breastfeeding counseling, carried out by the Care Group model. A Care Group is a team of 10 to 15 trained volunteers who provide health and nutrition education to residents within 10 to 15 households each, with the aim of changing behavior and health practices. Each integrated program center will implement one or several Care Groups depending on the number of 6-24 month old children enrolled in the program. The Care Group model is built upon multiplication of volunteer effort, peer support and community mobilization, thereby creating a social movement involving the entire community to foster positive behavior change. The key message is appropriate complementary feeding with continued breastfeeding in 6-24 month old children. Ancillary messages to be included are family planning, immediate and exclusive breastfeeding of infants 0-5 months, and safe hygiene practices. All health and community health workers involved in the project will follow a one week Care Group training to support adequate complementary feeding for the 6-24 month olds. Participation Standard Protocol These children will receive treatment in accordance with the 'National protocol for community-based management of acute malnutrition' of Sierra Leone, which reflects standard practice worldwide. The management scheme uses weight-for-height z-score (WHZ) to categorize children and includes separate care for MAM and non-complicated SAM, using different foods. A research assistant will be assigned to the standard care sites to collect informed consent, data, and to assess the availability of foods and supplies. If food is not available, the study will supply, as it is essential for making a valid comparison between the two protocols. Integrated Protocol Foods Children participating in the integrated treatment protocol will receive, as a supplement to the normal diet, 75 kcal/kg/d RUTF when MUAC ≥ 11.5 cm and edema has resolved, whether s/he was enrolled for MAM or SAM. Children with MUAC < 11.5 cm will receive 175 kcal/kg/d RUTF. Caretakers will be instructed to give her child the appropriate food for the child's nutritional status. RUTF for the integrated program will be formulated to comply with the new United Nations (UN) ready-to-use supplemental food (RUSF) requirements. RUTF for a 7.5 kg child at 75 kcal/kg/d meets or exceeds the Dietary Reference Intake, except for calcium, phosphorus, potassium, riboflavin and vitamin K, which should be provided in breast milk or the habitual diet. Children randomized to be in the integrated protocol group will be given a six-week supply of a 50 g LNS to complement their home diet after graduation. LNS is a mixture of peanut butter, fat and the correct mixture of micronutrients to achieve one Required Daily Amounts (RDA)/d for most vitamins and minerals. Coverage The Simplified Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS) Evaluation of Access and Coverage (SLEAC) method will be used to assess coverage. The ten treatment centers (five standard and five integrated) will each be assessed for coverage using simple surveys. SLEAC identifies the category of coverage (e.g. low, medium, high) of each treatment center, according to a threshold value, d, calculated as follows: where n is the sample size and p is the standard against which coverage is being evaluated. The Sphere minimum standard of coverage is 50% for rural areas, 70% for urban areas and 90% for camp settings11, so p = 50% for coverage assessments in rural areas, and d = 21 in this scenario. The sample size for each treatment center, n, is 42 (single sided test, 90% power, 5% significance with a control coverage estimated at 20% and intervention coverage estimated at 50%). Since it is likely that more than the exact number of cases will be found, d will be recalculated after coverage assessment. Villages to be visited for surveying are determined by the centric systematic area sampling or quadrat method (selects villages to visit based on geographic location), or by listing all villages and systematically selecting villages in the targeted catchment area for the program, depending on whether a map is available. Sampling ceases after all selected villages are visited, regardless of whether the quota of cases is achieved earlier or not. House-to-house sampling must be carried out to ensure that all MAM cases are found. This will additionally allow discovery of all SAM cases. Surveying of 14 areas with 15 mid-level health management staff and one principal surveyor required 44 days. It will take the same staff size ~32 working days to complete the survey for this protocol. Data Analysis Anthropometric indices will be calculated using Anthro v 3.1 (WHO) based on the WHO's 2006 Child Growth Standards. Data will be tabulated and analyzed using the statistical computer program SPSS 13.0 and Microsoft® Excel. A primary outcome is recovery under the integrated program and the standard protocol. Recovery at 1, 3 and 6 months follow-up with the standard protocol will be compared to the integrated protocol. The other primary outcome, coverage, is assessed by comparing survey data from each region; the number of cases found that have been treated are compared to the threshold value, d, and areas are categorized as having low, moderate or high coverage. All coverage analysis will be carried out according to previous published methods. Secondary outcomes are growth rates, duration of treatment, cost estimates for participation, reasons for defaulting and identification of risk factors for poor outcomes. Comparisons between treatments will be made using Chi-square test for categorical outcomes and ANOVA for continuous outcomes. P < 0.05 will be statistically significant. Specific Aim 2 will be conducted by International Medical Corps (IMC) Specific Aim 2: Evaluate the effectiveness of breastfeeding education and counseling on breast milk intake in 6-24 month-old children receiving RUTF in Sierra Leone. Hypothesis: An active, peer counseling program to preserve/promote breastfeeding in MAM infants will result in greater breast milk consumption than standard care. Methods Subjects: Eligible subjects will be children aged 6-24 months enrolled in the trial described in Specific Aim 1 that have reached MUAC > 12.5 cm. IMC will enroll children between 6-24 months of age whose caretaker will participate in enhanced breastfeeding counseling, carried out by the Care Group model or a modified version tailored to the context of the research program. Study design IMC will assist each integrated program center to implement one or several Care Groups depending on the number of 6-24 month old children enrolled in the program. The key message for this group of care givers will focus on appropriate complementary feeding with continued breastfeeding in 6-24 month old children Ancillary messages to be included are family planning, health care seeking behaviors, and safe hygiene practices. IMC will train all community health workers involved in the project in a one week intensive training on the Care Group approach to support adequate complementary feeding for the 6-24 month olds. Participation Caretakers will be approached for sub study enrollment immediately upon successful completion of therapy for MAM, during the interval when their children are receiving the LNS. It is anticipated that the children whose mother received the Care Group counseling will have greater breast milk intake. There are ample numbers of eligible children in the study such that if a mother chooses not to participate or drops out after agreeing, a replacement can be easily found.\",\n",

Approximately 24 subjects will take part in this investigator-initiated study at Georgetown University Hospital and Johns Hopkins Hospital. This study will last for one year (12 months).

       "  'Endothelium derived nitric oxide (NO) regulates vascular tone and blood pressure in man. NO also inhibits platelet aggregation and mediates a variety of beneficial anti-inflammatory and repair mechanisms. NO may also be a mediator in the release of the endogenous fibrinolytic factor, tissue-plasminogen activating factor (t-PA) from the endothelium.1 Via these actions it plays a very important role in protection of the vasculature from atherothrombosis and clinical sequelae such as myocardial infarction and stroke. Visible and ultraviolet (UV) light relax vascular smooth muscles by producing NO in a phenomenon known as photorelaxation.2 The investigators have demonstrated significant stores of pre-formed, bound NO and other nitrosospecies in human skin, which are rapidly released upon exposure to UVA.3 The investigators have demonstrated recently that serum nitrite and nitroso-species are increased after standing in a UVA phototherapy cabinet and that local UVA exposure is associated with increased forearm arterial blood flow that is independent of skin temperature. The investigators have also demonstrated a fall in mean arterial blood pressure in subjects exposed UVA. Cardiovascular morbidity and the prevalence of hypertension vary with latitude. The investigators hypothesise that some of this geographical variation may be explained by a diminished sunlight/UVA exposure with attendant negative effects upon NO bio-availability.4 To further examine the potential beneficial effects of UVA exposure we will examine the effects of whole-body UVA upon platelet activation and upon myocardial/coronary arterial flow reserve. The investigators will correlate these measures with systemic nitrate, nitrite and nitroso-species content in healthy volunteers. HYPOTHESES 1.

In recent years, there has been preliminary investigation into anesthetic injections for the undifferentiated headache patient presenting to the emergency department. It has been proposed that these patients presenting with benign headache might benefit from this novel treatment. Patients that present to the Emergency Department with a diagnosis of benign or primary headache with serious or life-threatening causes of headache will be offered enrollment into the study. Following consent, subjects will receive either 0.5% bupivacaine injected bilaterally in the paraspinal musculature of the cervical spine or the standard treatment with intravenous Prochlorperazine. The subjects will complete a validated pain scale before, and 20 minutes after injection. At twenty minutes post-injection, the subject will be reevaluated for symptoms. The subject will then be eligible for discharge or standard treatment at the discretion of the treating physician. Subjects will be followed for 72 hours after enrollment for headache recurrence. Subjects will be monitored for immediate and post-discharge complications.',\n",
       "  'Headache is a common chief complaint of patients presenting to the emergency department (ED), accounting for approximately 3 million ED visits per year. Headache treatment is often a source of frustration for both patients and providers. By the time patients with benign headaches arrive in the emergency department, they have often failed non-invasive therapeutic attempts and providers are often left with few therapeutic options. Treatment of benign headache varies between providers, often including systemic medications with a multitude of possible side effects. Additionally, most headache cocktails require prolonged duration of treatment, occupying valuable bed space in increasingly busy emergency departments. In recent years, there has been preliminary investigation into anesthetic injections for the undifferentiated headache patient presenting to the emergency department. It has been proposed that these patients presenting with benign headache might benefit from this novel treatment. Since 2003, paraspinal muscle injections of bupivacaine have been used in emergency department patients with encouraging results. The mechanism of action is not clearly understood; however, it has been proposed that these injections affect the trigeminocervical complex hypothesized to play an integral role in headache physiology, similar to the same mechanism behind greater occipital nerve blocks used by neurologists. To the best of the investigators knowledge, there has never been a prospective double-blinded randomized control trial addressing this novel approach to headache management. Even so, the topic of using bupivacaine to inject the paraspinal musculature of the cervical spine has gained wider recognition over the past year. The topic has been discussed heavily on emergency medicine blogs and podcasts. Additionally, online videos have been posted to educate emergency medicine providers on the injection technique. According to retrospective literature, clinical efficacy was observed with a significant proportion of the patients receiving therapeutic effect. These studies, along with anecdotal experience with the procedure at the investigators institution, have led to great excitement concerning the possibility of a new approach to emergency department headache management. However, the topic still needs investigation with a well-designed prospective clinical trial to determine true clinical utility.',\n",

       "  'RATIONALE: Successful allogeneic stem-cell transplantation is often limited by graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Migration of donor cells into tissues plays a major role in GVHD. Drugs that block chemokine receptors such as CCR5, can potentially decrease the migration of donor cells into tissues. Blocking CCR5 after allogeneic stem-cell transplantation may therefore reduce the rates of GVHD.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: 1. To assess the toxicity of a prolonged administration of maraviroc in patients undergoing RIC SCT. 2. To estimate the rates of severe (grade 3-4) acute GVHD by day 100 and 180, grade 2-4 acute GVHD by day 100, organ-specific acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, relapse, infections, non-relapse mortality, use of immunosuppressive therapies and 1-year survival in patients treated with maraviroc after RIC SCT. 3.

       "  'Uveal melanoma is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in adults. Despite successful control of the primary tumor, metastatic disease will ultimately develop in approximately 50% of the patients. The liver is the most common site for metastases, and about 50% of the patients will have isolated liver metastases. These metastases are generally refractory to systemic chemotherapy and the median survival for patients with liver metastases is about 6 months. Regardless of treatment, the mortality rate is approximately 90% at 2 years with only about 1% of the patients surviving more than 5 years. Isolated hepatic perfusion (IHP) is a regional treatment that was first performed more than 40 years ago (Aust and Ausman 1960). During IHP, the liver is completely isolated from the systemic circulation, allowing a high concentration of chemotherapy to be perfused through the liver with minimal systemic exposure. In a previous study from our institution, IHP was analysed based on improvements in the procedure and the results showed an improved outcome together with minimized morbidity and mortality over time. A phase II follow-up study confirms that IHP is a promising technique with tolerable morbidity. There are yet no randomized trials comparing overall survival in IHP, but in an attempt to answer this question the investigators did a register study showing a 14 months increased survival when comparing the patients treated with IHP with the longest surviving patients in Sweden during the same time period.',\n",

Drainage is undertaken passively by hanging the collection bag at the bedside in a dependent position. In addition to general demographic, clinical and radiological presentation data, potential risk factors for recurrence will be documented. Serial computed tomography brain scans will be arranged (before discharge, at four weeks and six months) and the occurence of significant subdural haematoma recurrence requiring repeat operative drainage at six months will be recorded. Other outcome measures to be determined at regular time intervals for a total follow-up period of six months (upon discharge, at four weeks and six months) include: functional performance in terms of the extended Glasgow Outcome Scale and modified Rankin Scale, added neurological deficit, death and other surgery-related complications. All outcomes will be documented by the trial investigators or by the responsible clinician. The data obtained will be analysed according to the principle of intention to treat. Hypothesis: compared to burr-hole evacuation of chronic subdural haematoma alone (control), the additional placement of a subdural drain after evacuation (intervention) will reduce the risk of recurrence requiring repeat surgery.\",\n",

       "  'The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of weight loss on ovarian morphology, metabolism, and body composition in overweight and obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).',\n",
       "  'Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrine disorders occurring in women of reproductive age. PCOS is considered a syndrome of ovarian dysfunction that is characterized by the heterogeneous clinical manifestation of infrequent or absent menstrual cycles, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovarian morphology. Since the majority of patients also present with obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and/or other risk factors for metabolic syndrome, there is a definite need for the development of therapeutic strategies to help these women lose weight and improve their metabolic and reproductive function. At present, there is evidence to suggest that the loss of as little as 5-10% of body weight through prescribed diet and lifestyle interventions can improve symptomology in women with PCOS. However, the mechanism whereby weight loss specifically stimulates ovulation and restores menstrual cyclicity is unclear. Hence, the goal of this study is to explore the effects of weight loss on ovarian morphology, metabolism, and body composition in overweight and obese women with PCOS. The researchers believe that a dietary intervention based on the nutritional recommendations of the USDA Dietary Guidelines for Americans, and supported by the Obesity Society and American Diabetes Association, will reduce the degree of metabolic disturbances and consequently restore healthy ovarian follicle development in women with PCOS. To accomplish these objectives, 30 overweight (BMI 25-29.9 kg/m^2) or obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m^2) women with PCOS will be evaluated every-other-day by 3D transvaginal ultrasonography during a 4-week baseline interval and 12-week commercial weight loss program (Nutrisystem® D). Participants will range in age from 18 - 38 and will not have used hormonal contraception, fertility therapies, or insulin sensitizers in the three months prior to enrollment. Ultrasound scans of the ovaries will be assessed for the total number and size of follicles using both two- and three-dimensional imaging techniques. Participants will have blood samples collected every visit to track changes in LH, FSH, estrogens, and progesterone during the scanning interval. The following metabolic parameters will be assessed at Week 2 of the baseline interval and Weeks 6 and 12 of the commercial weight loss program: (1) 75-gram oral glucose tolerance test to characterize glucose and insulin dynamics at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes post-glucose ingestion; (2) dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan to quantify body fat and lean muscle distribution; (3) vitals and anthropometry assessment to measure waist and hip circumference, height, weight, blood pressure, and heart rate, and (4) fasting blood tests to detect androgens (i.e., total testosterone, androstenedione, free androgen index) and serum markers of metabolic syndrome (i.e., lipids and hemoglobin A1C). Further, to evaluate the effects of ovarian morphology, metabolism, and body composition on sustained weight loss and/or weight maintenance in overweight and obese women with PCOS, participants will be invited to return six months after their intervention is complete. The aforementioned procedures, including transvaginal ultrasound, 75-gram oral glucose tolerance test, DXA, vitals and anthropometry assessment, and fasting tests will be repeated.',\n",

       "  'The VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL; NCT 01169259) is a randomized clinical trial in 20,000 U.S. men and women investigating whether taking daily dietary supplements of vitamin D3 (2000 IU) or omega-3 fatty acids (1 gram of omega-3 fatty acids) reduces the risk of developing cancer, heart disease, and stroke in people who do not have a prior history of these illnesses. This ancillary study (VITAL Adiposity) is being conducted among participants in VITAL and will examine the effect of vitamin D or fish oil on changes in body composition and adiposity (baseline compared to 2 year, as measured by anthropometric indices, total and regional body fat and adipokines) and assess whether changes in cardiovascular risk factors (lipids, glucose tolerance, blood pressure) are mediated by these parameters. How achieved 25(OH)D levels are affected by body composition and body mass will also be assessed.',\n",
       "  'Observational studies suggest that low 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels are associated with high BMI and fat mass (FM), but it is unknown whether vitamin D supplementation can alter body composition or adiposity. Despite enthusiasm for the use of vitamin D supplements to reduce FM, the hypothesis that vitamin D can modify adiposity remains unproven. Finding strategies to prevent obesity is of critical public health importance due to the high prevalence of overweight/obesity and its role in causing diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease (CVD), among others. Observational studies also link low 25(OH)D levels to CVD risk factors related to obesity, but sequestration of vitamin D in fat tissue may be a confounding factor. The effects of vitamin D supplementation on body composition, adiposity and CVD risk factors are best tested in a randomized clinical trial (RCT), and according to the Institute of Medicine (IOM) 2011 report, more data from randomized clinical trials on these outcomes are needed. Previous trials of vitamin D have been limited by the inability to separate effects of supplemental calcium from vitamin D, small sample size, insufficient vitamin D dose, failure to monitor 25(OH)D levels or inadequate ascertainment of body composition. The NIH-funded VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL) (1 U01 CA138962) affords a unique and cost-effective opportunity to investigate the effect of vitamin D on changes in body composition and to assess whether changes in CVD risk factors are mediated, at least in part, by these parameters. VITAL is a large-scale, randomized, primary prevention trial testing 2000 IU/d vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) and 1 g/day omega-3 fatty acids (840 mg EPA+DHA in 1.3:1 ratio) in a 2x2 factorial design among 20,000 men and women (≥50 and ≥55 years, respectively), with mean participant follow-up of 5 years for CVD and cancer. This ancillary study will address understudied areas and two overarching hypotheses that vitamin D supplementation (1) lowers total and regional (trunkal and abdominal/androidal) body fat as measured by dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans, improving biomarkers of adiposity (leptin, adiponectin) and (2) impacts CVD risk factors, at least in part through adiposity. The investigators also seek to define how circulating achieved 25(OH)D levels, due to supplementation, may be affected by body composition and BMI, thus elucidating how adiposity, BMI, and body composition (total and regional) may influence vitamin D intake needs in the population. To critically evaluate these hypotheses, the investigators will examine a representative, randomized subcohort of 1000 racially diverse VITAL participants (25% African American) over two years.',\n",

The goal of the project is to develop an implementation plan that would enable children with complex heart problems to lead healthy, active lives within their own community. The primary goal of the project is to promote physical activity, because the physical and mental health benefits of activity are very important for these children. Children with complex heart problems have a higher risk for obesity, diabetes, acquired heart disease and mental health problems than their healthy peers. The physical health benefits of physical activity are well known, but physical activity is also key for children's mental health. Physical activity enables children to socialize with peers and create bonds and friendships. Physical activity participation also directly elevates mood through the release of brain chemicals. Children with complex heart problems are also known to experience fear and anxiety related to physical activity. This project will also develop strategies to promote healthy eating and the prevention of physical activity-related injuries to these children and their families. Children with complex heart problems are at higher risk of overweight and obesity and face unique injury risks related to pacemakers or their medications. Extensive consultations with families and caregivers have identified needed supports for physical activity lifestyles, mental health, healthy eating and injury prevention for these children. The goal of the interviews was to understand the positive and negative influences on physical activity and healthy lifestyles for these children. Analyses of the interview content was used to develop a detailed, step-by-step implementation plan to provide the supports necessary for children with complex heart problems to lead active, healthy lives in their own community, with their family and friends. The implementation plan specifies changes to family education and counselling resources, clinical care routines, and communication among professionals and families. The clinical trial will evaluate the impact of implementing the family supports and changes to practice previously developed. Surveys will be completed by families attending the cardiac clinic before and after the changes to practice and additional resources are made available. Interviews will be utilized to gather additional feedback from professionals and families that receive counselling utilizing the supplementary materials.\",\n",

       "  \"Thousands of vein punctures are done every day at hospitals worldwide. Vein puncture are performed in connection with blood sampling, peripheral intravenous catheter (PIV) placement or blood donation. The predominantly used venous for blood withdraw are in the cubital region because in this area venous are most superficial placed and most often visible for the human eye. However, when using the usual blind landmark and palpation method in this region, it often proves exceedingly difficult or even impossible to obtain peripheral venous access on patients who are obese, chronically ill, hypovolemic or intravenous drug users. Various studies have shown that the success rate for establishing a vascular access with ultrasound compared to blind landmark technique is higher in patients with difficult access. When ultrasound is used to establish intravascular access, the prerequisite sterile puncture area can be challenging to meet due to ultrasound gel on the area and the fact that the ultrasound transducer cannot be wiped clean with alcohol after being in contact with a patient's skin or blood. A strict sterile procedure is important to reduce complications related to infection.The traditional way of coping with this is by covering the transducer and the wire in a long sterile sheet and using sterile gel. The sheet must be tight with rubber band around the transducer and pulled tightly around the transducer foot to prevent artefacts from appearing on the screen. This is an expensive and time consuming method, and it still leaves the problem with gel in the puncture area. The investigators have developed a method by where all these problems are solved by using, a slightly modified, commercial drape in combination with the Dynamic Needle Tip Positioning technique The investigators hypothesize that it is possible to perform ultrasound-guided venous puncture with a sterile and dry puncture area and that puncture can be performed proximal and distal to the traditional puncture side. It is a procedure presenting study that serves to demonstrate the feasibility of the method in ten healthy volunteers. The study will take place at Aarhus University Hospital, Skejby.\",\n",

       "  'There are two different treatment modes for NSCLC patients who failed to epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) after initially responding to EGFR-TKI. One is EGFR-TKI combined with chemotherapy and the other is chemotherapy followed by EGFR-TKI. It is unclear which one is more suitable to this group of lung cancer patients. So this phase Ⅱclinical trial is designed to compare the efficiency and safety of these two different treatment modes.',\n",
       "  'Responses to EGFR-TKIs are quiet dramatic and durable, especially in patients with EGFR gene classic mutations, such as 19 deletion or 21 leucine 858 arginine(L858R). However, most patients with NSCLC who respond to EGFR-TKIs eventually experience progression of disease after approximately 12 months. The lack of an established therapeutic option for NSCLC patients who have progressive disease after EGFR-TKIs failure poses a great challenge to physicians in terms of how best to manage this growing group of lung cancer patients. In clinical practice some of the initially EGFR-TKI sensitive tumors which progressed evidence a striking increase in tumor volume within several weeks, after being taken off EGFR-TKI. This response is called \"rebound phenomenon\". Most experts still believe that these tumors continue to be \"oncogene-addicted\" to EGFR. So it is rational that EGFR-TKI combined with another chemotherapy regimen can be used to treat NSCLC after the failure of EGFR-TKI therapy. However in some phase Ⅱclinical trials involved a few NSCLC patients who failed to EGFR-TKI therapy, another treatment mode, that is to say, at least one cytotoxic chemotherapy was used firstly then switched to EGFR-TKI therapy until progression of disease, was used and called reintroduction or retreatment of EGFR-TKI.

Furthermore, there is considerable confusion in the field regarding the pathophysiology of the disease and involvement of inflammation. To that end, this study is designed to address some of these questions by determining the proteomic profiles of KC patients with different clinical grades. This relatively large cohort study is expected to yield significant information regarding the molecules that are deregulated during progression of KC and may provide a framework to assign diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic intervention points.',\n",
       "  \"The screening of keratoconus involves keratoconus related clinical signs like retinoscopy scissors reflex, Munson sign, stromal thinning, Vogt's striae, and Fleischer's ring, but corneal topography is the most useful method in the diagnosis of keratoconus, especially in the absence of clinical signs. Several devices are currently available for detecting early keratoconus by measuring anterior and posterior corneal topography and elevation(Mihaltz et al. 2009; Ishii et al. 2012). Corneal topographic and tomographic techniques which generate color-coded maps and topographic indices, are the most sensitive devices for confirming the diagnosis of keratoconus(Rabinowitz 1998; Rao et al. 2002) were used for diagnosis in this study. In addition, videokeratography has been shown to identify Forme fruste keratoconus (FFKC) in the absence of clinical signs of keratoconus. Videokeratographic indices such as the Klyce/Maeda criteria, the Rabinowitz criteria, and others have been developed to quantitatively analyze videokeratography and screen for keratoconus(Rao et al. 2002). These indices have been shown to identify keratoconus with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity. The Orbscan II is a three-dimensional slit-scan topography system for analysis of the corneal surfaces and anterior chamber and has been used on all patients in the study. It uses calibrated video and a scanning slit beam to measure x, y, and z locations of several thousand points. These points are used to construct topographic maps(Rao et al. 2002). The Pentacam (Oculus Inc) is a corneal tomographer technology which generates data on topograophy and elevation of anterior and posterior using a rotating Scheimpflug camera which has also been used on all subjects enrolled in this study. Various diagnostic parameters are available for keratoconus diagnosis depending on what mode of topography is being used. Maeda and Klyce designed a system to detect keratoconus. The system, which is based on linear discriminant analysis and a binary decision tree, identifies the map as representing keratoconus or nonkeratoconus and, based on a value from the discriminant analysis (the KPI), assigns the map an index expressed as a percentage that suggests the severity of keratoconus. At this time, however, Keratoconus Severity Index (KSI) and the Amsler-Krumeich classification are the most popular methods for grading keratoconus severity(Mihaltz et al. 2009; Ishii et al. 2012). KSI is based on indices estimated by a curvature map using Placido disk-based corneal topography, and Amsler-Krumeich classification defines the stage of keratoconus using biomicroscopy, mean central keratometry reading, spherical and cylindrical refraction change, and corneal thickness(Mihaltz et al. 2009; Ishii et al. 2012). This is the index that has been used for the final gradation of keratoconus stages of all subjects in this study.\",\n",

This study is designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of an unadjuvanted subvirion monovalent inactivated influenza H3N2 variant (H3N2v) vaccine (MIV) manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur. Subjects will be stratified by age (approximately 100 (up to 120) subjects 18-64 years old and approximately 100 (up to 120) subjects >/= 65 years old) to receive two doses of H3N2v MIV, delivered intramuscularly as 15 micrograms (mcg) of hemagglutinin (HA)/0.5 milliliter (mL) dose, 21 days apart (see Table 1). Subjects may receive licensed seasonal influenza vaccine prior to (2 weeks if given the inactivated vaccine or 4 weeks if given the live, attenuated vaccine) the first H3N2v vaccination. Alternatively, subjects may receive licensed seasonal influenza vaccine at any time after completion of the Day 42 visit or following an early termination visit. Safety will be measured by the occurrence of solicited injection site and systemic reactogenicity on the day of each H3N2v vaccination through 7 days after each H3N2v vaccination, adverse events through 42 days after the first H3N2v vaccination, and serious adverse events (SAEs) and new-onset chronic medical conditions through 7 months after the first H3N2v vaccination. Immunogenicity testing will include performing hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and neutralizing (Neut) antibody assays on serum obtained on the day of and prior to each H3N2v vaccination (Days 0 and 21), approximately 8 days after each H3N2v vaccination (Days 8 and 29), and approximately 21 days after the second H3N2v vaccination (Day 42). From a subset of healthy adult subjects (up to 30 volunteers 18-64 years old enrolled at the Emory VTEU site who consent to blood donation for the immunology exploratory assays), an additional volume of venous blood will be drawn on Days 0, 8, 21, 29 and 42 to determine the specificity/cross reactivity of antibodies from H3N2v-reactive B cells with other influenza subtypes (e.g., 2009 H1N1 pandemic HA) and most recent H3 seasonal HA to define the molecular profile of antibody repertoire changes in circulating B cells after H3N2v vaccination, and to characterize the antibody-secreting cell (ASC), monoclonal antibody (mAb), and CD4+ T cell responses to H3N2v vaccination.

Neither you nor the study staff you will see in the clinic will know if you are receiving the study drug(s) and/or the placebo(s). However, if needed for your safety, the study staff will be able to find out which study drug you are receiving. If needed, you will be given standard drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects. You may ask the study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their risks. Study Drug/Placebo Administration: You will take the study drug/placebo 2 times a day for 6 weeks. You should take the capsules with a full glass of water. If you get an upset stomach, take them with food. You will be given pamphlets with more information about how to take the study capsules. You should bring your study capsules to every study visit. Completing the Symptom Questionnaire: Throughout the study, you will be asked to complete a questionnaire about your symptoms. This questionnaire will ask about symptoms from therapy you may be having and how they may be interfering with your daily activities. The study staff will either meet you during your regular clinic visit or call you at your home at a time that is convenient for you. In the clinic, you will complete the questionnaire by paper and pen, or by entering your answers into an electronic tablet computer. On the phone, a study staff member will ask you the questions and record your answers. You will complete the symptom questionnaire before you begin chemoradiation and then 1 time a week for the rest of the study. The symptom questionnaire will take up to 5 minutes to complete. Study Visits: Before you begin chemoradiation: - You will complete questionnaires about pain and other symptoms, your mood, and your quality of life. Completing all 5 questionnaires will take about 15 minutes. - If you can become pregnant and you did not have a pregnancy test during screening, you will have a urine pregnancy test. The study staff will give you the urine pregnancy test kit at your scheduled visit, and will review the results before you pick up the study capsules from the pharmacy. About Week 3 or 4, you will be asked to complete a questionnaire that asks you about your satisfaction with the study capsules. This will take a few minutes. During the last week of chemoradiation (about Week 5 or 6): - You will complete 3 questionnaires about your symptoms, mood, and quality of life. These questionnaires will take about 10 minutes total to complete. - You will also be asked to complete a questionnaire that asks about your satisfaction with the study capsules. This will take a few minutes. After about Week 5 or 6, the study staff will call you 1 time a week to check on you until the study ends. This phone call should last only a few minutes. If you have had several side effects from chemoradiation, this phone call may take longer. At your first routine clinical follow-up visit (about Week 10 to 14): - You will complete the 3 questionnaires about your symptoms, mood, and quality of life. - You will also be asked to complete another questionnaire that asks about your satisfaction with the study capsules. Length of Study: You will be on study for about 10-14 weeks. You will take the study drug(s) for 6 weeks and complete the symptom survey until the end of the study. You will be taken off study early if you have intolerable side effects. This is an investigational study. Armodafinil is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of sleepiness. Minocycline is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of bacterial infections. The use of these drugs to help reduce chemoradiation symptoms is investigational.

Five-year PFS and OS of the patients recieved classic CHOP regimen(cyclophosphamide,vincristin,doxorubicin and predisone)is less than 30%.High dose intensive chemotherapy doesn`t demonstrate better response. At present, there is no standardized treatment protocol for this kind of lymphoma. Between 1994 and 1998,the Scotland and Newcastle Lymphoma Group prospectively collected data on newly diagnosed patients with enteropathy associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL)in the Northern Region of England and Scotland,which is a rare and aggressive type of peripheral T-cell lymphoma.The novel regimen IVE/MTX (ifosfamide, vincristine, etoposide/methotrexate)-ASCT was piloted for patients eligible for intensive treatment,followed by auto-stem cell transplantation.Five-years PFS and OS were 52% and 60% respectively, significantly improved compared with the historical group treated with anthracycline-based chemotherapy. The encouraged results were extended to the peripherial T cell lymphoma-non specified(PTCL-nos). Past studies suggested pirarubicin was more active to the T cell lymphoma than doxorubicin in vitro based on its high concentration in tumor cells. Clinical data also presented equivalent even superior efficacy of pirarubicin with lower toxicity than doxorubicin. The aim of our study is to compare the response and survival rate of CTOP/ITE/MTX (cyclophosphamide, vincristin,pirarubicin and predisone/ ifosfamide, pirarubicin, etoposide/methotrexate) with those of CHOP regimen,looking forward to its superiority in efficacy and safety for the de novo young patients with T cell lymphoma.',\n",

Ponatinib is designed to block the function of BCR-ABL, which is the abnormal protein responsible for causing CML. This may cause the cancer cells to die. Ponatinib may cause a blood clot to form in an artery or in a vein. Depending on the location of the clot, this could cause a heart attack, a stroke, severe damage to other tissue, or death. A blood clot may occur within 2 weeks after you start taking the drug. About 25% (1 in 4) of patients taking the drug form an abnormal clot. Blood clots can occur in patients that do not have other known risk factors for forming clots. If you develop a blood clot, you will need to stop taking ponatinib. In some cases, emergency surgery could be needed to remove the clot and restore blood flow.',\n",
       "  'Study Drug Administration: You will take ponatinib by mouth 1 time every day while you are on study with about a cup (8 ounces) of water. You may take ponatinib with or without food. If you vomit a dose, you should not take ponatinib again to make up for that dose. You should wait until your next scheduled dose. You will complete a study diary in which you will record the date and time that you take the study drug each time. If you miss any doses, you will also note this in the study diary. You will bring this diary to every study visit. Study Visits: The study staff will help you schedule your study visits. The following tests and procedures will be performed: - Blood (about 1/2 tablespoon each time) will be drawn for routine tests every 1-2 weeks for the first 4 weeks, every 4-6 weeks for the first year, every 3-4 months for second year, then every 4-6 months after that. These tests can be done by your home doctor and sent to your study doctor. - You will have an EKG every 3 months for the first year. - You will have a physical exam and you will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and any side effects you may be having every 3 months for the first year, then every 6-12 months after that. - Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn to check the status of the disease every 3-4 months for the first year, then every 6-12 after that. - You will have a bone marrow aspirate for genetic testing and to check the status of the disease every 3-4 months for the first year, then every 6-12 months for the next 2 years, then every 2-3 years after that. Length of Study: You may take the study drug for up to 5 years. You will be taken off study early if intolerable side effects occur, if the disease gets worse, or if you are unable to follow study directions. Your participation on the study will be over when you have completed the follow-up visit/call (described below). If the disease gets worse or the disease never responds to treatment with ponatinib, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn about 30 days after your last dose of ponatinib to check for changes in the BCR-ABL protein which may explain why there was no response to the study drug. Follow-Up: Within 30 days after you leave the study, you will be called or you will come to the clinic to learn about any side effects or symptoms you may be having. If you are called, this call will last about 2-3 minutes. This is an investigational study. Ponatinib is FDA approved to treat patients with certain types of leukemia.

       "  'Assessment of retinal vessel calibers combined with bidirectional Fourier domain optical coherence tomography (FDOCT) for measurement of retinal blood velocities is a new and sophisticated method for assessing retinal blood flow in humans. The valid measurement of retinal blood flow is of significant importance, because it is known that major ophthalmic diseases are associated with alterations in blood flow. As such, retinal vascular occlusive diseases represent a major cause of visual impairment and blindness. The prevalence of the disease is between 0.7 and 1.6%. Compression of the retinal veins at arterio-venous (AV) crossings plays an important role in the development of branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO). The mechanical narrowing of the vessel lumen is supposed to be the mechanism behind this fact. The present study should elucidate how BRVO influences retinal blood flow at retinal vessel crossings in comparison to healthy control subjects. Retinal blood flow at retinal bifurcations will also be assessed. In addition, a fundus image will be taken to assess retinal oxygen saturation. For the first time we use a combination of a dynamic vessel analyzer (DVA) with bidirectional Fourier domain optical coherence tomography (FDOCT) to assess retinal blood flow. Whereas the DVA provides information concerning retinal vessel caliber, FDOCT provides laser Doppler information in addition to conventional optical coherence tomography, allowing the observation of blood flow dynamics simultaneously. In the present study we hypothesize that the DVA in combination with FDOCT is a suitable new tool for the assessment of blood flow in healthy subjects and in patients with BRVO.',\n",

Thirty three with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients (diagnosis of probable AD according to the criteria of the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke Alzheimer Disease and Related Disorders Association [NINCDS-ADRDA] were included in this study) were randomly classified into one of three groups (eleven for each group). The first group received anodal tDCS over left DLPFC and 2rd group received cathodal tDCS on the left DLPFC and the 3rd group received sham tDCS stimulation, daily for 10 consecutive days (5 days/week for 2 weeks). Minimental State Examination (MMSE), psychometric assessment for cognitive functions (MMSE, Wechsler memory scale, Wechsler adult Intelligent scale) were assessed before, after 10th sessions, and then after 1 and 2 month. Cortical excitability was assessed in both hemispheres before and after the end of sessions. Neurophysiological evaluations included resting and active motor threshold (rMT and aMT), and cortical silent period (CSP). At the time of recruitment, none of the patients taking antidepressants, or neuroleptic, sedative-hypnotic drugs for at least two weeks before the assessment. All participants or their caregivers will give informed consent before participation in the test and after full explanation of the study protocol. Outcome: The real group received (anodal and cathodal) tDCS are expected to have more improvement on cognitive functions compared to sham tDCS group. tDCS is considered new adjuvant non pharmacological therapeutic tool for management of AD patients with mild to moderate degree dementia.\",\n",

This will be assessed over a period of one year. In addition this study will test whether the iVAPS mode is superior to BiST mode with respect to: comfort and ease of use; improvement in nighttime and daytime symptoms of hypoventilation; compliance (hours used per day); physiologic parameters (daytime and overnight oxygen saturation and transcutaneous CO2 level).',\n",
       "  \"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is incurable, progressive, manifested by muscle weakness and wasting, and caused by degeneration of motor neurones. The limited data available suggest the incidence of ALS in Canada to be approximately 2 per 100,000 persons. The disease is characterized by progressive weakness of respiratory muscles, leading to respiratory insufficiency which is often the cause of death in patients with ALS. Home non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is the standard-of-care as initial therapy for patients with ALS with worsening symptoms or deteriorating respiratory function, and has been recommended by the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) practice parameter for ALS. The symptomatic and survival benefits offered by NIV to patients with ALS make the optimization of ventilation a priority in terms of physiological variables but also symptoms to improve comfort, and consequently, compliance. The Intelligent Volume-Assured Pressure Support (iVAPS) is a ventilator mode on the Stellar 150 ventilator (Resmed) that uses an algorithm to target alveolar ventilation. It has a learning mode to determine the initial optimal settings to commence ventilation, and is an adaptive mode, which constantly monitors the patient's spontaneous ventilation and adjusts the level of pressure support to maintain target alveolar ventilation. The aim of the study is to determine the feasibility of long-term non-invasive home ventilation in ALS patients using the Stellar 150 IVAPS mode, initiated during a single daytime trial, and to assess the number of respiratory therapist interventions subsequently required as well as several patient-centered outcomes. The study will be conducted among patients with ALS referred to the National Program of Home Ventilatory Assistance (NPHVA) at the Montreal Chest Institute. The province-wide program provides home ventilation services to patients with a variety of neuromuscular and other disorders. Referred patients will be randomized to receive traditional Bilevel ventilation in ST mode (BiST) or iVAPS and will be followed over a period of one year. Respiratory therapist interventions (beyond scheduled visits) and changes in ventilator settings will be based on patient complaints and aimed at optimizing patient comfort and ventilator use. In addition, symptoms questionnaires will be administered regularly, overnight oxymetry and transcutaneous capnography (at 6 and 12 months) will be performed. Compliance data will be assessed regularly from ventilator memory downloads at each of the scheduled respiratory therapist home visits (1 week, 1, 6 and 12 months).\",\n",

       "  \"When having certain types of outpatient surgery inside the uterine cavity some women experience heavy bleeding. The only method presently available for controlling such bleeding, short of removing the uterus, involves the placement of a balloon pressure device inside the uterine cavity. The pressure along with the patient's own natural clotting ability will generally stop the bleeding. However, this treatment usually requires at least a 24 hour stay in the hospital. The investigators are researching the use of a compound (FloSeal) already approved for use in other areas of the human body, as a method of controlling bleeding. The use of FloSeal in the uterine cavity has not yet been tested and therefore is not yet an FDA approved indication for its safe use to control bleeding from the uterine cavity. In this study, The investigators want to find out what effect(s) FloSeal has on the uterine cavity. Twenty individuals will be included in this study at Northwest Hospital Center. All twenty individuals will be treated in the same fashion except ten of the participants will randomly be assigned to receive FloSeal and ten will not. Study participants are individuals currently scheduled to have a hysterectomy procedure, which involves surgically removing the uterus from the body for a previously determined standard of care treatment for a non- cancerous medical problem. Before performing the hysterectomy and evaluating the effects of FloSeal upon the tissues within the uterine cavity the following will be done. Once under anesthesia the uterine cavity will be subjected to a curettage (sharp scrapping) to produce a minor amount of bleeding from the lining of the uterus. Ten of the 20 study participants, randomly chosen, will then have FloSeal placed into their uterine cavity. The study participants will not know whether they received FloSeal or not. A balloon pressure device will then be placed into the uterine cavity of all 20 individuals and left in place for 5 minutes. After the allotted time, the balloon device will be removed. The hysterectomy will then be completed appropriately using standard methods and techniques. The uterus, once removed will be evaluated pathologically to determine the effects of the FloSeal upon the tissues of the cavity in those so treated and compared to the same analysis in those individuals who did not receive FloSeal. The pathologist will not know which patients received or did not receive FloSeal. This use of FloSeal is not currently an FDA approved use of the compound. The goal of this study is to obtain FDA approval for use in this situation.\",\n",

The intervention is currently being implemented in 2 districts (Magu and Sengerema) in Mwanza Region on the northwest shore of Lake Victoria. It is nested within the IntHEC Community Randomised Trial which aims to evaluate the impact of a complex RH intervention on the uptake and integration of reproductive health services in 2 Regions in Tanzania (Mwanza and Iringa) and Niger (Say and Aguie) respectively. 18 wards per region were stratified according to geographical and economic criteria and randomly assigned to intervention or comparison wards. The SMS intervention is being implemented in 9 intervention wards in Mwanza Region only. 9 wards are followed for comparison.',\n",
       "  \"The SMS intervention was developed in 2 phases: (i) stakeholder consultation and (ii) technical design. Twenty-three consultation meetings were held with 78 drug store owners and attendants, 45 dispensary and health centre clinical officers and nurses, and 148 adolescents in communities. These stakeholders prioritised key deficiencies in existing RH provision and preferred strategies to address them. Detailed methods and results of these consultations are presented elsewhere (Consultation Paper in preparation). In brief government health facilities wanted an intervention that allows dispensaries and health centres to take charge of STI treatment and provide skilled service for other RH needs. Drug stores wanted an intervention that recognises and integrates their contribution to the health system, while adolescents wanted an intervention that promotes accessibility, confidentiality and trust of service providers. Through subsequent meetings, an SMS intervention strategy was identified because all clinical officers and drug store attendants demonstrated use mobile phones on a day-to-day basis. The intervention design prioritised patients' ease of access to service: when a patient comes to a drug store to buy medicines for a RH related problem that may require a prescription drug, the drug store explains the referral system. If the patient accepts, the drug store sends a text message with the patient details to a toll-free number connected to a web-system. The system processes and forwards the patient details including a password to a dispensary matched with the referrer drug store. At the same time, that password is sent back to the referrer drug store so that it can be passed on to the patient. While at dispensary, patients with a password are received, matched with details received in text messages, and given fast track RH service, after which the dispensary sends a text message to the toll-free number confirming the completeness of patient treatment. This intervention is implemented in all 9 intervention wards in Mwanza. No intervention is implemented in the 9 comparison wards.\",\n",

In this research study the investigators are looking to see if taking afatinib after surgery works better when taken over a short period of time, compared to a long period of time.',\n",

Many of these tests and procedures are likely to be part of regular cancer care and may be done even if it turns out that one does not take part in the research study. If the patient has had some of these tests or procedures recently, they may or may not have to be repeated. These tests and procedures include: a medical history, performance status, physical exam and vital signs including height and weight, an assessment of your tumor, routine blood tests, pregnancy test, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram and/or multigated acquisition scan. If these tests show that a patient is eligible to participate in the research study, they will begin the study treatment. If one does not meet the eligibility criteria, they will not be able to participate in this research study. Because no one knows which of the study options is best, the patients will be \"randomized\" into one of the study groups. They will take afatinib by mouth every day for either 3 months (short course) or for 2 years (long course). Randomization means that one is put into a group by chance. It is like flipping a coin. Neither the patient, nor the research doctor will choose what group the patient will be in. You will have a 50/50 chance of being placed in any group. Regardless of which study group one is put in, all patients will take afatinib by mouth every day. The first cycle will last 28 days. All cycles after that will last 25-31 days. Patients will take their medication (tablets) by mouth once a day, at about the same time each day. They should take afatinib with a glass of water. Afatinb treatment will continue until the assigned course is completed, or until there are side effects that cannot be tolerated, or one decides to stop study treatment, of if the lung cancer returns.

       "  'Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a virus that causes verrucae, or warts, on the skin, particularly of the distal extremities, and lesions of the mucous membranes. Warts are highly prevalent, occurring in up to 13% of the general population and in around 25% of otherwise healthy children. About 67% of warts resolve spontaneously within two years; however more than 25% will persist for many years, some resulting in pain or dysfunction and some imparting significant psychosocial problems. Localized hyperthermia (warming) has been reported to be effective in the treatment of HPV-induced warts for nearly two decades. A novel method of treating warts with heat is the use of an occlusive patch that contains a mixture of chemicals (ferric chloride), which in the presence of oxygen reacts to generate reproducible thermal warming of the skin to a temperature of 42-43ºC for at least two hours. The heat is believed to alter the immune response and kill the HPV virus in the wart tissue.',\n",

       "  '\"Sudden cardiac arrest\" occurs when someone\\'s heart stops beating unexpectedly. Each year, more than 45,000 Canadians have a cardiac arrest. A bystander can do three things to improve survival: Call 911,start chest compressions and apply a defibrillator. Together, these actions can increase survival by up to 800%. The problem is that bystanders to cardiac arrest only provide CPR in about 3 of every 10 cardiac arrest cases and AED use in about 3 of every 100 cardiac arrest cases. There are many people in the community who are trained and willing to provide help for cardiac arrest victims such as off-duty paramedics, fire fighters, nurses, etc. When a cardiac arrest occurs in the city, it is likely that one of these people is nearby, but unaware of the emergency. The PulsePoint smartphone application enables these people to be notified by the local emergency 911 service when there is a cardiac arrest near to them. It can be freely downloaded to several common types of smartphones. When there is a cardiac arrest emergency, all nearby PulsePoint users are sent an alert from the 911 service. When the phones receive the alert, they ring, vibrate and display a text message saying \"CPR NEEDED\". The user\\'s current location and the exact location of the cardiac arrest are then displayed on a map. Nearby public access AEDs are also indicated on the map. The smartphone users can then go to provide chest compressions and use an AED while paramedics are on their way. A video at www.pulsepoint.org shows how this works. The objective of the investigators is to measure whether the PulsePoint smartphone application increases bystander CPR or AED use for victims of cardiac arrest outside the hospital. This project will happen in the City of Toronto. The investigators have a plan to get as many people as possible to download the application, focusing on health care professionals who know CPR. The investigators will set up a webpage that helps people download the software to their phone. The investigators will randomize 911 calls to have a PulsePoint alert sent or not. The investigators will use statistical analysis to measure whether sending an alert to a smartphone increases the chances of bystander resuscitation.',\n",

       "  'The purpose of this study is to find out if giving glycerin suppositories will help decrease the length of time premature infants need phototherapy. The investigators hypothesize that glycerin suppositories (initiated along with phototherapy) will have no effect on reducing duration of phototherapy in premature infants with jaundice.',\n",
       "  'Neonatal jaundice is one of the most common clinical problems in the neonatal period (Maisels). Physiologic hyperbilirubinemia is usually benign and transient in nature. Bilirubin overproduction, delayed hepatic clearance, and increased enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin all contribute to neonatal jaundice (Bader). Previous studies have shown that delayed meconium evacuation might be an important contributing factor in the development and persistence of neonatal jaundice (Rosta and Porto). Once conjugated bilirubin is excreted from the liver to the small intestine, it is often deconjugated in the presence of alkaline media and beta-glucorinase enzymes which are present in abundance in premature infants. Once deconjugated, unconjugated bilirubin is reabsorbed leading to entero-hepatic circulation, which plays a significant role in the development on neonatal jaundice. Previous studies have shown that early meconium evacuation was associated with lower total serum bilirubin levels and decreased risk for clinically significant neonatal jaundice (Jirsova, DeCarvalho, Boyer, Gourley, Salariya and Gourley). Other studies in healthy term neonates have shown no benefit from rectal glycerin in reducing peak serum bilirubin levels. Bader et al performed a prospective study to evaluate the general effect of glycerin suppository administration in reducing total serum bilirubin levels in healthy term neonates. Glycerin suppositories were given immediately after birth and every 4 hours thereafter, until evacuation of first stool. The suppositories had no effect on mean total serum bilirubin levels at 48 hours of age. It was concluded that glycerin suppositories should not be routinely recommended as a means for reducing the severity of neonatal jaundice. However, it was found that in a subgroup of male infants with blood group type A there were significantly lower mean total serum bilirubin levels after induction of earlier meconium evacuation with glycerin suppositories. Weisman et al performed a similar prospective study in healthy term neonates and found that giving glycerin suppositories does hasten the passage of meconium and transitional stool; however, there was no effect on peak serum bilirubin levels during the first 3 days of life and no effect on need for phototherapy. Chen et al described a prospective, randomized controlled trial with two groups of healthy term neonates. The experimental group received glycerin enemas at 30 minutes and 12 hours of life. Bilirubin levels were followed for the first 7 days of life. The intervention had no effect on peak serum bilirubin levels or serum bilirubin levels in the first 7 days of life. No data exist on the use of glycerin suppositories in premature neonates, although its use is a common practice to increase meconium clearance and stooling in the case of hyperbilirubinemia. However, it may not be a justified practice, based on data for full-term infants. Experts argue that premature neonates may have upward of 25% more enterohepatic circulation than full-term neonates (S. Amin, personal communication). Therefore, because premature neonates have the potential to recirculate bilirubin, increasing stool frequency through schedule glycerin suppositories might play a therapeutic role in the management of hyperbilirubinemia in this population. It is a common practice in our unit to provide glycerin suppositories every 8 hours to infants under phototherapy in an attempt to more rapidly reduce bilirubin levels by decreasing enterohepatic circulation of unconjugated bilirubin. This practice is not evidence-based, nor is it standard practice in many NICUs throughout the country. Glycerin suppositories are not without risk.

       "  'Given the resistance emergence of malaria in pregnant women receiving intermittent preventive treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPT-SP) and the burden of this infection among pregnant women infected by HIV it is urgent to seek a more effective alternative treatment to optimize the prevention of malaria. Cotrimoxazole (CTM), actually administered daily as a prophylactic mean to opportunistic infections for HIV infected patients, showed encouraging results in preventing malaria in pregnant women. However, these results must be confirmed by randomized trials, particularly in pregnant women. The main objective of this clinical trial is to compare the efficacy of cotrimoxazole (CTM), administered once daily with IPT-SP (3 curative doses spaced one month) on placental parasitaemia in pregnant women infected with HIV and cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) > 350 cells/mm3. The main hypothesis is based on the premise that cotrimoxazole is more effective than IPT-SP for placental parasitaemia. This might be due to the higher plasma concentration of cotrimoxazole attained with daily doses. If this hypothesis is proven, cotrimoxazole could be recommended as prophylaxis for HIV-positive pregnant women, whatever their CD4+ cell count. In this study, the investigators will also test the hypothesis that the strains of Plasmodium falciparum isolated from HIV-positive pregnant women express more dhfr and dhps resistance markers.',\n",
       "  \"Ascertainment of HIV serological status has become a prerequisite for better prevention of malaria. Studies reported that cotrimoxazole reduces malaria episodes in adults (other than pregnant women), and in children. Furthermore, several studies showed a good clinical and parasitological response to cotrimoxazole in treated children. Therefore, preventive treatment with SP for all HIV+ patients (including pregnant women) who are receiving treatment containing cotrimoxazole is superfluous and is even contraindicated because of the increase risk of severe adverse reactions. Few studies, however, have described the efficacy of cotrimoxazole in the prevention of malaria in pregnant women, particularly in an area where the frequency of therapeutic failures with SP in cases of Plasmodium falciparum malaria is increasing. The emergence and augmentation of the frequency of resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to SP, which has already been observed in numerous countries of sub-Saharan Africa and in the Central African Republic, challenges the short-term usefulness of this drug combination in the prevention of malaria in pregnant women. The resistance is due to accumulation of point mutations at various sites on the genes coding for dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) and dihydropteroate synthase (dhps). The number of mutations correlates with the extent of resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to SP in vitro. In studies carried out in Bangui, the prevalence of therapeutic failure was estimated to be 23.8% after 14 days of follow-up among children with uncomplicated malaria, while the resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to pyrimethamine in vitro was reported to be 38.3%. The frequency of mutations in dhfr and dhps alleles is correlated with in vitro response of Plasmodium falciparum strains to SP. Pregnancy and HIV infection increase the risk for emergence of mutated strains that are resistant to SP, because a wide variety of types and clones are found in parasitaemia in pregnant women (genetic diversity). Furthermore, some studies raised concern about the possible development of cross-resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to both cotrimoxazole and SP because of the similarity of their mode of action, although this hypothesis has not been proven. The national malaria programme in the Central African Republic recommends the use of IPT-SP since 2006. The investigators' main hypothesis is based on the premise that cotrimoxazole is more effective than SP for placental parasitaemia. This might be due to the higher plasma concentration of cotrimoxazole attained with daily doses. If this hypothesis is proven, cotrimoxazole could be recommended as prophylaxis for HIV+ pregnant women, whatever their CD4+ cell count. In this study, the investigators will also test the hypothesis that the strains of Plasmodium falciparum isolated from HIV+ positive pregnant women express more dhfr and dhps resistance markers.\",\n",

Patients eligible for participation were aged 18-60 yrs., ASA physical status I or II and BMI < 30 kg/m2. Before anesthesia induction, CP was verified as follow: the cricoid cartilage was first identified and then held between the thumb and middle finger and the pressure was applied by the index finger with a force that could be tolerated by the patient. After loss of consciousness, four predetermined forces: 0 , 10 , 20 and 30 N were chosen in a randomized method. Therefore, after applying the predetermined force, a GT 20 F insertion trial was performed and two outcomes were considered: 1) Failure of GT insertion: effective CP. The next trials were not attempted. 2) Success of GT insertion: ineffective CP. The patient received a second attempt with increasing force to the next scale of force. If the attempt was effective (failure of GT insertion) , the relevant force is considered as the effective CP force. Same trial was repeated using 0, 10, 20 and 30 N respectively in in a randomized fashion for each patient. The cricoid force was standardized by reproducing 10, 20 and 30 N on a weighing scale prior to each application. Four anesthesia providers (operators) participated in the study: The first operator performed CP in all patients with his back towards the video monitor; the second operator performed laryngoscopy using GVL and GT insertion trials and he was not aware about the nature of study ; the third operator assessed the effectiveness of the applied CP and determined the position of the esophageal entrance in relation to the glottis. The fourth operator, who was standing behind the second operator, signaled to the second operator to start attempt for each trial with the predetermined CP forces and to the first operator who applying CP to stop or continue accordingly. In order to \"blind\" the second operator, a screen separated the laryngoscopist and the first operator applying CP, while the hand position for the CP was maintained, even when CP was not applied.

       "  \"Reliable diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) at the predementia stage is currently considered to be a priority for research, as disease modifying therapies are being evaluated. Many studies focus on the functional and morphological assessment of the hippocampal formation. However, neurofibrillary tangles, associated with cognitive deficits, initially affect the anterior subhippocampal cortex (transentorhinal, entorhinal and perirhinal cortex) before reaching the hippocampus. Studies from our group have tried to investigate if the assessment of subhippocampal regions using cognitive tools and neuroimaging techniques could contribute to the diagnosis of AD at a very early stage. In a previous project, the investigators included 40 patients with single domain amnestic MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment), known to be at high risk for AD and demonstrated that aMCI patients with a profile of subhippocampal dysfunction (impaired performance on a visual recognition memory task) display other clinical as well as imaging profiles of patients with early AD using MRI and SPECT. Longitudinal follow-up data in these patients is currently under way. Preliminary data indicates that evaluating the subhippocampal region using visual recognition tasks is highly predictive of AD over 6 years. The aim of this project is to obtain additional diagnostic data using a PET amyloid tracer (Florbetapir F18 AV45 F18), an in-vivo marker of one of the neuropathological lesions that define AD, of in order to enhance diagnostic accuracy AD in these patients. This approach will validate the hypothesis as to whether the assessment of subhippocampal dysfunction can contribute to the early diagnosis of AD.\",\n",

       "  'Sustaining Transfers Through Affordable Research Translation (START): Knowledge Translation Interventions to Support the Uptake of Innovations in Continuing Care Settings',\n",
       "  'Currently, the health care that people receive is approximately 20 years behind up-to-date research findings. Developing ways to narrow the gap between evidence and practice is an important research focus in continuing care facilities, especially when one considers that the demand for these facilities is estimated to increase ten-fold in the next 25 years. In Alberta, there are an estimated 27,400 healthcare aides working in the continuing care sector. Developing reminders targeting these care providers will increase the likelihood that the significant resources invested to promote the uptake of research findings will lead to sustained practice change and, ultimately, improved client outcomes. The purpose of the START project (Sustaining Transfers through Affordable Research Translation) is to help bridge this gap between research and practice in supportive living and long-term care facilities by studying the effectiveness of reminder interventions to support the sustainability of a research-based mobility innovation. In particular, the project will evaluate the frequency and intensity of reminders that maintain the daily practice of healthcare aides to carry out a mobility innovation with clients in 24 supportive living and long-term care facilities. We will compare monthly versus every three month reminders, and we will compare paper-based reminders (like a sticker on a chart) and reminders provided by a healthcare aide peer. Using interviews, questionnaires and observations, the START project will also evaluate the processes that inhibit or promote the uptake of the mobility innovation by healthcare aides in their daily practice. In building this bridge between research evidence and practice, we will work closely with stakeholders at all levels of healthcare delivery (e.g. healthcare aides, facility leaders, policy makers and researchers) throughout the study. We expect our collaboration to contribute to sustainable innovations in the continuing care sector and, in particular, to the sustained use of an affordable mobility innovation in supportive living and long-term care settings.',\n",
       "  'The purpose of this cluster randomized controlled trial is to study the effectiveness of reminders to support the sustainability of an affordable mobility innovation by healthcare aides in supportive living and long-term care facilities. Using a stratified 2x2 factorial design, we will determine which combination of frequency and intensity of reminders is required to sustain a mobility innovation, the sit-to-stand activity. Four research questions guide our study: 1) Do more frequent reminders (every month) improve the sustainability of the innovation by healthcare aides in supportive living and long-term care facilities compared with less frequent reminders (every 3 months)? 2) Do high-intensity reminders (paper-based reminders plus peer reminders) improve the sustainability of the innovation by healthcare aides in supportive living and long-term care facilities compared with low intensity reminders (paper-based reminders only)? 3) Do more frequent reminders plus high-intensity reminders synergistically improve the sustainability of the innovation by healthcare aides in supportive living and long-term care facilities? 4) What are the processes associated with the ongoing uptake of the innovation over a year of follow-up? We propose to study the effect of varying levels (frequency and intensity) of reminders on the sustainability of a mobility innovation by healthcare aides. Frequency: Our Alberta Health Services collaborators advised that monthly modification of the paper reminders would be frequent yet feasible while aligning with the rhythm of other monthly managerial responsibilities; in contrast, every three months would be infrequent but would align with quarterly managerial responsibilities. Intensity: They agreed that paper-based reminders are low intensity and commonly used in clinical settings. For the high intensity reminder they favored a socially-based \"peer reminder\". To summarize, the level of reminders will vary in frequency (monthly versus every three months) and intensity (paper reminders versus paper reminders + peer reminders). Project Plan: Facility assessment: Eligible facilities will have a minimum of 30 designated supportive living beds or long-term care beds in the Edmonton zone. In the first six months, we will conduct a facility assessment with 24 potential facilities using the Alberta Context Tool, the Work and Well Being Survey, and the Resident Assessment Instrument Minimum Data Set 2.0. Data from this assessment will be used to stratify the facilities into three \\'equivalent\\' groups for randomization. As part of the organizational eligibility, all participating facilities will agree to incorporate the mobility innovation as a best practice policy for their clients. Education sessions: In collaboration with the facility-based educator, a study educator will complete 20-minute education sessions to train healthcare aides working day and evening shifts to complete the innovation. Randomization: A stratified blocked randomization procedure will assign facilities to four intervention arms. Immediately following randomization, we will introduce a simple set of paper-based reminders to all sites. The low intensity paper-based reminders include: a) affixing stickers to doors, walls, or bathrooms; b) posting reminder signs in prominent locations; and c) placing colored flags on the documentation flowsheets. Every month for the high frequency sites, and once every three months for the low frequency sites, we will modify the color or shape of the paper-based reminders. For the high intensity reminders, we will identify healthcare aides to offer peer reminders. These healthcare aides will provide formal and informal peer reminders about the innovation; the formal reminders will take place either monthly or every three months during change of shift meetings, while the informal reminders will be provided as opportunities arise during the work day. Every month for the high frequency sites and every three months for the low frequency sites, the study educator will coach the healthcare aides providing peer reminders. As the purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of reminders to support the sustainability of an innovation by healthcare aides, our primary outcome is healthcare aide uptake as operationalized by the number of completed mobility occasions. We have validated a documentation flowsheet for use by healthcare aides. They will record on this flowsheet the number of mobility repetitions that the client completes on each of two occasions on the day shift and on the evening shift (i.e. four occasions per day). The secondary outcome measure will be client mobility, as assessed using the 30-second sit-to-stand test. Clients will be timed to see how many repetitions of standing up and sitting down they can complete in 30-seconds. This measure will be gathered once at baseline for all participating clients, and again 1 year later. Process Evaluation (Research Question 4): The goal of the process evaluation is to understand how facility processes and reminders affect the sustainability of healthcare aide uptake of the innovation. We will examine how the reminders are implemented and perceived by participants, as well as how healthcare aides providing peer reminders are identified, received by their peers and supported by their supervisors. This data will gathered using observations, questionnaires and interviews. Observations: Anytime research staff enter a study facility, they will be alert to observe responses of facility staff or clients to the reminder interventions. Upon exiting the facilities, they will record fieldnotes. Research staff will be instructed to include only general information in their fieldnotes, and not include information that would identify specific site staff or clients. Educators\\' fieldnotes will be useful for understanding processes of and responses to coaching the healthcare aides that provide reminders. Questionnaire: We will survey a licensed practical nurse and a manager from each facility using a questionnaire to elicit perceptions of the reminders. Interviews-Healthcare Aides: To understand healthcare aides\\' views of the reminders we will use interviews rather than written questionnaires, as many healthcare aides speak English as a second language. We will interview approximately 6 healthcare aides from purposively sampled facilities until we achieve saturation. Four facilities (2 positive & 2 negative extreme cases; one from each arm) will be sampled based on facility assessments. Interviews-Peer Reminders: To understand the peer reminder experience we will interview approximately 6 healthcare aides providing peer reminders from each high intensity reminder arm until saturation is achieved.',\n",

       "  'The main purpose of this study is to test the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose, and effectiveness of bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Because bevacizumab is not considered standard therapy for sarcomas, it can only be given to subjects with sarcoma who are enrolled in this research study and may only be administered under the direction of doctors who are investigators in this research study. This study is being done because sarcomas can recur after surgical resection (surgery for removal of the tumor), radiation therapy and chemotherapy. This recurrence can occur in the same location as the original tumor or in distant sites such as the lung. Thus better treatments are needed. This research study is a Phase I clinical trial. Phase I clinical trials test the safety of an investigational drug, combination of drugs, or combination of drugs with radiation. Phase I studies also try to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug to use for further studies. \"Investigational\" means that the combination of drugs and radiation is still being studied and that research doctors are trying to find out more about it. It also means that the FDA has not approved bevacizumab with doxorubicin and radiation for your type of cancer.',\n",
       "  'In order to determine if patients are eligible for this study patients will undergo some screening procedures, including a medical history, physical examination, performance status, assessment of tumor, chest CT scan, blood tests, urine test, electrocardiogram and echocardiogram. Patients will also undergo blood tests and a tumor biopsy to look for markers for your particular type of cancer. If it is determined that patients are eligible to be in the study they will need to have a central venous line (CVL), peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC), or portacath placement. Doxorubicin administration requires a central venous line, peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) or portacath to be placed to allow continuous infusion of this drug. Since the investigators are looking for the highest tolerable dose of the study drug, bevacizumab, that can be administered safely without severe or unmanageable side effects in participants that have sarcoma, not everyone who participates in this research study will receive the same dose of the study drug. The dose patients get will depend on the number of participants who have been enrolled in the study and how well they have tolerated their doses. The dose of doxorubicin and radiation therapy will be the same for all subjects throughout the study. Bevacizumab will be given as an intravenous infusion (IV). The first infusion will take about 90 minutes. All other bevacizumab infusions will take either 60 or 30 minutes, if tolerated. The first infusion will be given on a Monday (excluding holidays). Patients will receive the second infusion 2 weeks later and then every 2 weeks after that for a total of 3 doses. Doxorubicin will be given as an intravenous infusion (IV). It will be given through a port via an infusion pump about the size of a large wallet that can fit into a front-pack or \"fanny-pack\" around their waist. This pump will be connected to their body. The nurses in the infusion room will start the pump and disconnect it after 4 days. The first bolus infusion take will be given 1-2 hours after their first bevacizumab infusion and will take about 30 minutes. This will be followed by a continuous IV infusion of doxorubicin over 4 days. The first bolus infusion will be given on a Monday (excluding holidays) and the continuous infusion will go until Thursday. Patients will receive a second bolus infusion followed by a 4 day continuous infusion every week for 5 weeks. Patients will begin radiation therapy after their first bevacizumab and doxorubicin infusion on Monday (excluding holidays). Radiation therapy will be delivered five days per week (Monday through Friday-excluding holidays) over a period of 6 weeks. This is done as an outpatient procedure. Each 2-week period will be considered a separate treatment cycle. Patients will be treated with radiation therapy for a maximum of 3 cycles (6 weeks). The following tests and procedures will be done during the study during weeks 2, 4 and 6 and before surgery: a medical history, physical examination, performance status, blood tests, urine tests and assessment for any side effects. Patients will have additional CT scans of their chest and tumor before surgery. An ECG will be repeated at this time. A surgeon will evaluate the tumor by reviewing radiologic studies before study treatment to determine if surgical removal is possible. After patients complete study treatment with radiation therapy and bevacizumab, a surgeon will repeat the evaluation of the tumor by reviewing radiologic studies to determine if surgical removal is still possible. Patients will have surgery 6-7 weeks after they finish radiation therapy. Patients will have additional radiation therapy if the research doctor thinks that some cancer cells may have been left in their body in the area where the tumor was removed. The radiation may be given while patients are in surgery or about two weeks after the surgery. This will be determined by the surgeon and or radiation oncologist. Patients will be in this research study for about 3 months. After the last dose of the study drug the investigators would like to keep track of their medical condition for 10 years. The investigators would like to do this by calling patients by telephone once a year to see how they are doing.

       "  \"Objectives: The objectives of the pilot study were to (1) test the feasibility of recruitment, randomization, and retention; (2) test the feasibility of a standardized Nurse-Supported Advance Care Planning Intervention; (3) evaluate the feasibility of the assessment process and data collection procedures; (4) evaluate the Veterans' satisfaction with the intervention and their Advance Directive decisions; and (5) evaluate preliminary effects of the Nurse-Supported Advance Care Planning Intervention. Research Design: This was a prospective, randomized, controlled, unblinded pilot study. Alabama Veterans who received care through the Tuscaloosa VA Medical Center were randomized to either the Nurse-Supported Advance Care Planning Intervention or Care-as-Usual in a 2:1 ratio respectively. Data related to recruitment, randomization, and retention; study completion by subjects; completeness of data collection; Veterans' satisfaction; and preliminary effects of the intervention were collected, analyzed, and evaluated. The length of the study was one year. Methods: The setting for the study was Tuscaloosa VA Medical Center care sites. A convenience sample of fifty subjects was recruited from Tuscaloosa VA outpatient clinics including Selma, residential settings, Home Based Primary Care, and the Mobile Health Unit. The level of care of subjects was all-inclusive, excepting current Hospice or Palliative Care. Selection procedures included self-referral and referral by Tuscaloosa VA Medical Center staff. Entry requirements were the meeting of all inclusion criteria and verification of no exclusion criteria. The Nurse-Supported Advance Care Planning Intervention was a manualized education, support, and guidance session provided by a Registered Nurse that included information about risks, benefits, and alternatives of specific choices. The Care-as-Usual was a session with the social worker who explained what the Advance Directive is, and guided the Veteran regarding the process of completing the Advance Directive document, without providing information about risks, benefits, and alternatives of specific choices. Study enrollment period was six months. The primary study outcome measure was Advance Directive completion rate. This pilot was not a hypothesis testing study. The underlying hypothesis of the eventual full study is that the Nurse-Supported Advance Care Planning Intervention is associated with Advance Directive completion rates at least comparable to that of the As-Usual care. Significance: This study supports the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) mission to provide Veteran-centered care. It provides important information needed to plan a full study of the effectiveness of a specific Nurse-Supported Advance Care Planning Intervention to facilitate Advance Directive completion by rural Alabama Veterans.\",\n",
       "  \"Background: The VHA mission to serve the health care needs of America's veterans assumes a veteran-centered approach - one that evolves not only from the health team's assessment of needs, but especially one that begins with the veteran's assessment of his or her own needs. Preliminary data from the Alabama Veterans Rural Health Initiative study suggest that approximately 30% of rural Alabama veterans do not have an Advance Directive and want help completing one. Rural Alabama veterans live in counties with a higher percent of African American minorities, lower levels of education, and higher family poverty rates, than the average for the US population at large. Prior studies have demonstrated that disparities in Advance Directive completion rates may be related to race, level of income, and level of education. VHA research priorities include addressing the challenges of minority health care needs and the disparities that arise in healthcare delivery. Although many studies evidence the effectiveness of education and counseling in facilitating Advance Directive completion, data are lacking that demonstrate the efficacy of resource-conservative nursing interventions to enable Advance Directive completion by rural, southern minorities. This pilot lays the groundwork to address this evidence gap. Objectives: The objectives of the pilot study were to (1) test the feasibility of recruitment, randomization, and retention; (2) test the feasibility of a standardized Nurse-Supported Advance Care Planning Intervention; (3) evaluate the feasibility of the assessment process and data collection procedures; (4) evaluate the Veterans' satisfaction with the intervention and their Advance Directive decisions; and (5) evaluate preliminary effects of the Nurse-Supported Advance Care Planning Intervention. Methods: A prospective, randomized, controlled pilot study. Fifty Alabama veterans who receive care at the Tuscaloosa VA Medical Center were randomized to either the Nurse-Supported Advance Care Planning Intervention or Care-as-Usual.

       "  \"Fatigue is highly prevalent among multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and has pervasive adverse effects on daily functioning and quality of life. The investigators found in a recent study that obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea (OSAH) is the most common sleep abnormality in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. There was also a significant relationship between OSAH and higher fatigue scores in MS patients. Preliminary work from the investigators in this group of subjects shows that treatment of sleep disorders (mostly OSAH) can improve fatigue and other symptoms in some MS patients. However, it is now necessary to systemically test the effect of OSAH treatment in a randomized, controlled study, to be sure that it really does improve fatigue and other symptoms. The best treatment for OSAH in the general population is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). This treatment has been well tolerated by most MS patients who have used the device at the investigators' center. This project will therefore be a randomized, controlled, clinical trial of CPAP in MS patients with OSAH. The effects of six months of CPAP treatment on fatigue as well as sleep quality, somnolence, pain, disability, and quality of life will be studied.\",\n",

       "  'Longer first line chemotherapy duration has recently been associated with a modest, but significant improvement in overall survival and a clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival, in metastatic breast cancer patients. Prolonging chemotherapy until disease progression, however, must be weighed against the detrimental effects of continuous chemotherapy delivery. The SNAP trial seeks to improve the tolerability of prolonged chemotherapy administration strategy by studying alternative treatment schedules, while preserving and possibly improving treatment efficacy in this disease setting. The availability of a new nanoparticle albumin-bound taxane, nab-Paclitaxel (Abraxane®), represents an opportunity to test this hypothesis. Nab-Paclitaxel has been developed in an attempt to reduce the toxicity associated with standard taxane administration (caused by the use of chemical solvents) while increasing antitumor efficacy. The SNAP randomized phase II trial evaluates three schedules of nab-Paclitaxel as prolonged chemotherapy administration strategy. Each of three arms will be compared to a historical reference of seven-month median progression-free survival (PFS) based on the most recent trial with docetaxel as control arm to determine whether any of the three arms are worthy of further investigation.',\n",

       "  'US scan was shown to be effective and useful for investigation of shoulder diseases. It is easy to implement and return, not expensive and not invasive, and precise for assessment. Glenohumeral joint is most inspected in elderly population. Most of shoulder syndromes are not related to joint diseases, but to adjacent tissue problem. However, US is preferred method for assessment GHJ by rheumatologists. But inflammatory changes in GHJ found limited attention in medical imaging literature. So far there is assessment of GHJ synovitis with disclosure of synovial fluid and pannus in subdeltoid (subacromial) bursa and biceps tendon, connected to GHJ space, by axillar and posterior access. Subdeltoid bursitis and biceps tenosynovitis are common used for inflammatory assessment of the shoulder. Anterior approach for GHJ assessment has not been used before our last trial. A problem of patients with synovitis in GHJ is difficulties to pick up shoulder to lateral side (abduction) till 90 degrees for axillar approach. We proposed anterior access for GHJ synovitis assessment. Certain position of the shoulder and measured data of healthy controls enabled diagnostic of GHJ synovitis with minimal movement of ill shoulder. In other report we showed US differences between GHJ and subscapular tendon on the anterior approach. These two publications showed anterior shoulder US in sitting position with arm externally rotated and supinated. We should recognize problems of these trials related to wrong identification of GHJ space. As we realized later this incorrect detection was associated with missing two orienteer structures: GHJ cartilage located behind and subcscapular tendon situated forward to GHJ space. From our present view, these two criteria are corn stone for GHJ visualization. Because lack obvious picture of these 2 structures GHJ demonstration is unclear and exposed to confusion with subscapular tendon. Moreover, our further experience of multiple anterior US studies showed that presentation of GHJ in position for supination and external rotation in sitting position is associated with poor visualization of GHJ cavity. The reason is position of GHJ to be hidden behind humeral head due to differences between round humeral head and oval glenoid and twist GHJ structure forward-upper-laterally. Daily practice helped to resolve the problem. We found: a patient should be laid down supine, his elbow is bent to 90 degrees and the shoulder is rotated maximally externally. This condition is associated to fix shoulder girdle, glenoid move anteriorly, humeral head move posteriorly, and much more complete external shoulder rotation is achieved opening GHJ for investigation. Shoulder CT shows that glenoid surface is in plane open to upper, forward and lateral side. It obligates to turn of transducer according to direction of investigated joint placed along the glenoid surface. That means, longitudinal study of GHJ requests transducer position under certain angle along to joint line. Transversal study is implemented under angle 90 degree to the joint line. Other problem is that synovitis may developed at early stage only within limited region of the joint and in region much more susceptible to inflammation and dilatation, like that rotator interval: anterior upper region which is covered only by the joint capsule with lower resistance to distention. That region is referred as rotator interval, a distance between supraspinatus (laterally) and subcapularis (medially) tendons attachment, when shoulder supinated and externally rotated. This region has been recently used for synovial biopsy. Materials and methods: US will be performed for 20 healthy controls and 20 patients with RA. US scan will be fulfilled symmetric both sides. Diagnosis RA is relied on anamnesis data, physical examination, and laboratory findings. Synovial swelling, synovial tenderness, local fever of joint region, active and passive limitation, accelerated erythrocyte sedimentation rate(ESR) upper 40mm/hr (N<12), C reactive protein (CRP) upper 1.5mg/dl (N<0.5) were clinical signs of active inflammation. Twenty healthy controls did not complain of shoulder pain and limitation and their physical examination was unremarkable. Study process: US scan will be performed as prospective study for 20 healthy controls from department of preventive medicine and for 20 patients with RA age of 20-60 by to classic approaches: posterior and inferior and new anterior access.

       "  'Amblyopia is a developmental condition that is characterized by reduced vision of the eye due to the presence of a sensory impediment during visual development, such as strabismus (ocular misalignment) or anisometropia (unequal refractive error), occurring early in life. Recent studies in humans and animals point towards a cortical locus for the processing deficit in amblyopia, revealing sensory deficits at the signal cell level. If changes in retinal neuronal function are also present, is unknown. Like in the brain, blood flow in the retina is coupled to neuronal activity. This phenomenon has been measured by different study groups with non invasive techniques in the brain and retina. It has been shown in previous studies that stimulating the retina with diffuse luminant flickering light increases retinal vessel diameter and blood flow. However, it is unknown whether this is also the case in the retina of amblyopic eyes. Additionally, the introduction of blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fMRI also makes it possible to directly access the vascular response in the brain to visual stimuli. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to investigate the effect of luminant flickering light on retinal vessel diameter and retinal blood flow in subjects with amblyopia. Also, oxygen saturation in retinal vessels will be assessed as well as pattern ERG for assessment of retinal function. Additionally, a high resolution image of the visual pathway will be taken with 7 Tesla MRI to investigate whether anatomical or functional alterations are present.',\n",

       "  'In patients with advanced heart failure (HF), systemic congestion is the main indication for hospitalization. Recent evidence has highlighted the role of fluid retention in the pathogenesis of renal dysfunction and subsequent diuretic resistance. Previous kidney disease, diuretic resistance, and progression of renal dysfunction often coexist in patients with HF and persistent volume overload. This clinical presentation represents the most extreme feature of the cardio-renal syndrome. However, available therapeutic options for this ominous condition are scarce and limited. Indeed, there are no data from randomized control trials using pharmacological interventions that support the beneficial effect on survival. Interestingly, intermittent ultrafiltration has recently emerged as an alternative therapeutic option for reducing volume overload in patients with refractory HF. Current literature suggests that it has potential advantages over standard medical treatment particularly in acute stages of HF. Among ultrafiltration methods, peritoneal dialysis (PD) has been preferred as an additional resource for the treatment of advanced congestive heart failure (CHF) compared with hemodialysis because it can provide a more physiological and continuous ultrafiltration. In fact, several studies showed that use of PD improved clinical functional class and hemodynamic parameters and reduced hospitalization rates in patients with CHF. Nevertheless, most studies were limited by retrospective analyses of small sample size, prospective observational design with no control group, or inclusion of patients with end-stage renal failure. Therefore, well-designed prospective randomized controlled studies are mandatory to confirm the effects of PD in these patients.',\n",

The investigators hypothesize that fully uncovered laser peripheral iridotomy will produce less significant dysphotopsia, due to avoidance of the prismatic effect produced by the tear film than those covered.',\n",
       "  'Nd:YAG LPI is a frequently performed procedure for patients who have narrow angles at risk of acute angle closure glaucoma, pupillary-block conditions, chronic angle closure, and pigment dispersion syndrome. Most complications associated with the procedure are benign and include intraocular pressure (IOP) spike, transient uveitis, hyphema, corneal or lens damage and closure of the iridotomy. Visual disturbances have been also reported but only a few papers address this specific issue. The rate of these symptoms vary between 2.7% and 4%. It is believed that these symptoms are associated with the fact that light enters through the LPI and thus creating abnormal visual symptoms. Hence it has been suggested to carefully place the LPI so that the eyelid fully covers the LPI, therefore preventing light getting through. However, reports of patients with fully covered LPIs and visual disturbances have led to hypothesize the theory that even when fully covered by the eyelid, light can access through the LPI by a base-up prism created by the tear meniscus at the lid margin. Therefore, placement of the LPI, fully covered, partially covered or totally uncovered can potentially lead to equally significant symptoms. This study will attempt to address the issue of placement of the LPI in relationship with visual symptoms.',\n",

       "  'Primary liver cancer (hereinafter abbreviated as PLC) is one of the most common types of malignant tumors in clinical practices. Its global prevalence is rising year-on-year and surpasses 626,000 per year. Ranking at No. 5 among all malignant tumors, its mortality rate approaches 600,000 per year and becomes No.3 of tumor-related death. As one of the prevalent regions of PLC in the world, China has a morbidity population of around 55%. Among the tumor-related death, it stands at No. 2 second only to lung cancer. So PLC has been a major hazard to health and life for Chinese citizens. Surgical resection has remained the first therapeutic choice of PLC. However, the disease course of PLC is insidious. In clinical practices, less than 30% of PLC patients may be treated surgically by hepatectomy. And their postoperative occurrences of recurrence and metastasis stay at a high level. As demonstrated by large-sample clinical trials in China, the 5-year postoperative recurrent rate of PLC was as high as 61.5%. The relevant studies have indicated that the surgical therapy of PLC has encountered a bottle-neck over the last decade and the control rates of postoperative recurrence or metastasis remain basically the same. Therefore the recurrence and metastasis of PLC are important limiting factors for its clinical therapeutic gains. Effectively lowering the post-therapeutic recurrence and metastasis of PLC has become a breakthrough point for improved clinical efficacies. At present, there is still no standard therapeutic protocol for the prevention of recurrence and metastasis of PLC. Independently developed recently by China, licartin has been the first radioimmunological targeted therapeutic agent approved for PLC in the world. Since its marketing in 2007, it has achieved excellent clinical efficacies and social recognition. As demonstrated by the results of relevant basic and clinical researches, licartin had definite efficacies for primary hepatocellular carcinoma and it could boost the efficacies of integrated PLC therapy, prolong the patient survivals and enhance the benefits of clinical therapeutics. Early studies have also proved that it could prolong the survivals of PLC, improve the quality of life and prevent the postoperative recurrence and metastasis. The present clinical trial is intended to examine the efficacy and safety of radioimmunotherapy via intravenous infusion of licartin plus sequential immunotherapy of CIK cell in the controls of disease progression, effective prolonging of recurrent time and prevention of recurrence or metastasis of primary hepatocellular carcinoma. This clinical trial is designed to provide one kind of modalities for preventing the recurrence and metastasis of PLC.

       "  'Pharmacological closure of ductus arteriosus with prostaglandin (PG) inhibitors has been used for years. Previous studies indicated that ibuprofen has similar effect on ductal closure as indomethacin but has less adverse effects on renal function, cerebral blood flow and mesenteric blood flow.1-7 There are, however, very few studies being done specifically on extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infant < 1000 g. This group of infants has immature kidney and often has poor response to PG inhibitors and has high mortality and morbidity. We hypothesized that, in ELBW infants, the ductal and renal response to PG inhibitors may be different between indomethacin and ibuprofen.',\n",

Enhanced oxidation has been suggested to be the underlying abnormality responsible for some of the complications of diabetes. Haptoglobin (Hp) is an abundant plasma glycoprotein produced in the liver. The best understood function of Hp is to bind free hemoglobin (Hb) released from red blood cells. Extracorpuscular Hb is a potent Fenton reagent.capable of of inflicting oxidative tissue damage. Hp binds to Hb and serves to inhibit the oxidative potential of Hb by preventing the release of heme iron. The haptoglobin (Hp) gene at chromosomal locus 16q22 is polymorphic, with two common alleles denoted 1 and 2. the prevalence of Hp 1-1, Hp 1-2 and Hp 2-2 genotypes is approximately 16%, 48% and 36%, respectively.

Doctors and researchers have tests which determine the level of function and sensation, this test was developed by the American Spinal Cord Injury Association (ASIA) and has been modified over the years to improve use and sensitivity. Most recently, the ASIA Injury classification Scale (AIS) was modified in 2011, but this test does not include the evaluation of autonomic nervous system (ANS) impairment. However, people with SCI do have impairment of the ANS and this may adversely affect how organ systems in the body function. Specifically, ANS impairment tends to result in changes in heart rate and blood pressure that may relate to the level of the SCI, but this is not fully understood. In this investigation we hope to develop simple tests which will allow doctors and scientist the ability to measure the amount of ANS impairment to the cardiovascular system, specifically the heart. The first part of the study will be to determine the heart rate response to several tests (administration of drugs and physical challenges) which will change heart rate. These tests will be given to people with and without SCI and the heart rate response will be compared between people with and without SCI. The bigger the difference in the heart rate response to these test between people with and without SCI the greater degree of ANS impairment in the people with SCI. Once this heart rate difference is determined, several simple tests (deep breathing, saliva test, Valsalva) will be performed in people with and without SCI to again compare the heart rate response. The second part of this study will be to determine if the heart rate responses to the first set of tests (administration of drugs and physical challenges) can predict the heart rate response to these simple tests (deep breathing, saliva test, Valsalva). The aim of this study is to develop a simple battery of tests which can be easily used by doctors and scientists to determine the degree of ANS impairment to the heart in persons with SCI.',\n",

       "  'Rationale: In the past decade multiple agents targeting specific signaling proteins important for tumor growth, including (tyrosine) kinase inhibitors, EGFR inhibitors, mTOR inhibitors and BRAF inhibitors, or agents that modulate the immune response such as ipilimumab, have been developed and have reached clinical approval. Initially it was anticipated that these agents would be active without causing major toxicities, but recent clinical experiences have changed these expectations. Diagnostic tools to predict whether a patient will develop toxicity to targeted agents are not yet available. Our general hypothesis is that immunophenotyping studies combined with (phospho) proteomic and kinase activity profiling in normal tissue before and during treatment with targeted agents may provide more insight in underlying causative mechanisms of toxicity and provide potential biomarkers for clinical use to predict for toxicity. The investigators hypothesize that targeted therapy- induced toxicity is caused by interference with normal physiological homeostasis at the tissue level. To date, preclinical strategies to predict for clinical toxicities of targeting therapies are lacking. This study is intended to (1) explore the biological (immunological) mechanisms of targeted agents at the systemic and local tissue level in relation to toxicity (2) determine if off-target receptor kinase inhibition in normal cells and tissues is related to toxicity of the treatment and (3) try to identify novel biomarker(s) predictive of toxicity. Objective: The main objective of this pilot study is to determine the biological impact of treatment with targeted agents at the systemic and local tissue level in relation to toxicity. Study design: Single center, non-randomized, interventional pilot study with feasibility analysis after enrollment of 20 patients. Study population: Adult patients with advanced solid tumors, for whom standard palliative treatment with targeted agents as monotherapy is indicated, including antiangiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitors, EGFR inhibitors, mTOR inhibitors, BRAF inhibitors and ipilimumab. Intervention: Patients will be treated with targeted therapies according to the clinical standard guidelines. At this point, five targeted therapies with considerable skin and gastrointestinal toxicities have reached widespread clinical use and therefore \"antiangiogenic\" tyrosine kinase inhibitors, EGFR inhibitors, mTOR inhibitors, BRAF inhibitors and ipilimumab will be investigated in this study. After feasibility analysis in the first twenty patients, twenty more patients will be included in each of the five drug cohorts. Biopsies will be performed to determine possible immunohistochemical and histopathological changes in normal tissue, possible immunomodulatory changes as expressed by Tcell phenotyping and cytokine profiling and to compare tissue (phospho) proteomic and kinase activity profiles before and during therapy and also at the development of toxicity. Main study parameters/endpoints: The main objective is to explore the biological impact of treatment with targeted agents at the systemic and local tissue level in relation to toxicity. This objective will be assessed by studying in normal tissue whether treatment with targeted agents induces significant changes in normal tissue of (1) histopathology, such as differences in the presence of infiltrating immune cells, (2) (phospho)proteomic profiles and (3) kinase activity profiles. Secondary objectives are (1) to perform pharmacokinetics and to study whether serum peptide profiles and systemic circulating immune cells and cytokine profiles in patients during treatment with targeted agents are related to toxicity and (2) to identify novel biomarkers predictive of treatment induced toxicity based on pretreatment systemic or local tissue phenotypes. Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: Enrolment in this study is possible when the indication to receive standard targeted therapy has been determined. Adverse events as a result of this standard treatment may occur. Biopsies of skin, oral mucosa, colon mucosa once prior to and during treatment will be taken. If toxicity develops, a re-biopsy of the affected area will be taken. These biopsies may cause physical discomfort. During therapy, follow-up will include laboratory analysis on a visit to the outpatient clinic.

       "  \"Reducing medical malpractice in ambulatory care represents a priority area that has been relatively neglected in the face of more dramatic and costly inpatient errors. Given shifts in care, increasing stresses on office practices, growing evidence of unreliable office processes, and recent experience of our malpractice insurance carriers, neither complacency nor resignation to the problems of ensuring safe patient-centered office care can be justified. Working with the two leading malpractice insurers in Massachusetts, we have assembled a consortium to improve patient safety and decrease malpractice risk in ambulatory practice-the Proactive Reduction in Outpatient Malpractice: Improving Safety, Efficiency and Satisfaction (PROMISES) project. We work with leading quality improvement and safety experts to employ state-of-the art approaches and tools to achieve breakthrough changes in demonstration practices. The project has the following three specific aims: AIM 1. Apply evidence from malpractice claims to identify key failure modes contributing to ambulatory medical errors and malpractice suits in order to redesign systems and care processes to prevent, minimize, and mitigate such errors in a group of Massachusetts primary care practices. We will target problem-prone processes in 3 areas of identified risk: 1) medication management, 2) test ordering and results management 3) follow-up and referral management. AIM 2. Transform communication culture, processes and outcomes in demonstration practices to become more patient and family-centered, particularly around proactively seeking out, hearing, handling, and learning from patients' safety experiences, concerns and complaints. AIM 3. In conjunction with key Massachusetts policy leaders, liability insurers, clinical, academic, quality improvement and consumer organizations, we will evaluate and disseminate the lessons learned and share successful intervention tools and strategies statewide with a broader audience of practices, practitioners, payers, and policy makers. The intervention would be designed as a randomized control trial comparing 16 demonstration practices with 9 control practices, each with 2-5 primary care providers recruited by the malpractice insurers. We will measure the effects of the improvement efforts using rigorous quantitative and qualitative data from staff interviews, patient surveys and chart review.

       "  'Complementary feeding diet in developing countries cannot meet iron requirements of infants and young children. Iron supplementation is mostly used to treat iron deficiency whereas iron fortification is cost-effective strategy to control iron deficiency in developing countries. However, a recent study showed that iron fortification imposed negative impact on gut microbiota by increasing colonization of gut pathogen over beneficial bacteria. Gut microbiota plays essential roles in nutrient absorption, vitamin synthesis; intestinal mucosal barrier function and pathogen displacement. Iron is essential for growth and virulence of most gut pathogens and so iron supplementation might have similar negative impact on gut microbiota composition. Therefore, nutrition interventions would not be justified by assessing micronutrient status alone ignoring any possible deterioration of gut microbiota. The investigators hypothesized that optimizing the nutrient intake from locally available foods according to complementary feeding recommendation (CFR) can improve the iron status of these children while maintaining healthy gut microbiota composition. A randomized, placebo-controlled, community-based, intervention trial will be conducted in Ayeyarwady division of Myanmar where childhood undernutrition is prevalent. The aim of this study is to compare the effect of optimized CFR to iron supplementation on iron status and gut microbiota composition of 1-2years old Myanmar children. Cluster randomization will be done at the village level to randomly allocate the villages into CFR or non-CFR villages.

       "  \"In recent years, Endocrinologist and Diabetologists have found that intestine might serve as a novel target for treating diabetes or other metabolic diseases. Incretins are well-known hormones secreted from intestine, such as CCK（Cholecystokinin), Serotonin, GIP(gastric inhibitory polypeptide) and GLP-1(glucagon like peptide 1), to help control wholesome metabolic status through their effects on pancreatic islet cells, hypothalamus neurons and gastrointestinal movement. Gut microbiome has been recently revealed exerting major effect on host's immune system and metabolic balance with its various metabolites and components. α-glucosidase inhibitors have been used as anti-diabetes medicine for dozens of years. They are known to be effective by delaying glucose absorption in small intestine. Questions then have been arisen that if delaying glucose absorption changes the intestinal bacteria flora component by increasing bacteria fed on glucose, or that if it influences incretin secretion, since most glucose sensitive L cell (secreting GLP-1) were located in the distal part of small intestine and colon, and that if the hypoglycemia effect of α-glucosidase inhibitors might be mediated by either intestinal flora or incretins. To address the questions above and to find the new targets from the intestine to treat diabetes, we therefore design this study, taking advantage of clinical trial and basic biomedical studies to find if α-glucosidase inhibitor- Acarbose (Bayer, Corp.) could change the profile of intestinal incretins and microbiome. Study design: 1. Multi-center, open label, randomized, positive control cohort. 2. 110 cases of newly-diagnosed Type-2 Diabetes patients from five clinic centers from Shanghai, China Mainland. 3.

Our hypothesis is that prophylactic treatment with aggressive intravenous hydration protects against ERCP pancreatitis.',\n",
       "  \"1.0 BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESES Post endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) pancreatitis is defined as the development of epigastric pain radiating to the back accompanied by either an increase in the pancreatic enzymes (amylase and lipase) to greater than three times the upper limit of normal or cross sectional imaging showing inflammation of the gland. Based on length of hospitalization it is categorized as mild (2-3 days), moderate (4-10 days), or severe (>10 days). Cases complicated by hemorrhage, pseudocyst, phlegmon formation or requiring percutaneous intervention or surgery are also scored as severe. Post ERCP pancreatitis is the leading complication of biliary endoscopic procedures and could potentially lead to considerable morbidity. The overall incidence of ERCP pancreatitis ranges from 5% in the community to 15% in centers where advanced ERCP including pancreatic interventions are performed. Proposed mechanisms include protease and free radical mediated inflammation, abnormal sphincter of oddi pressure, and elevated pancreatic exocrine activity. Measures to prevent post-ERCP pancreatitis aim to curb these processes. Numerous trials studying the use of various preventive therapies including octreotide and protease inhibitors have been for the most part disappointing. There have been more than twenty clinical trials examining the efficacy of somatostatin and octreotide which inhibit pancreatic exocrine stimulation. A meta-analysis of nine high quality trials of somatostatin showed that overall the medication did not reduce post ERCP pancreatitis. Gabexylate mesylate and ulnistatin which inhibit pancreatic proteases have also shown to not significantly reduce post ERCP pancreatitis. Numerous studies have also shown that corticosteroids do not diminish the likelihood of post-ERCP pancreatitis. The mainstay of treatment for acute pancreatitis independent of origin is aggressive hydration. The rationale for this is that hypovolemia and microvascular hypoperfusion are critical to the development of pancreatic necrosis. In animal models it has been demonstrated that pancreatic blood flow decreases in the setting of pancreatitis. Regions of hypoperfusion correlate with regions of severe histologic inflammation. Studies of fluid resuscitation in patients with interstitial pancreatitis have demonstrated that those treated with inadequate fluid resuscitation have an increased risk of developing pancreatic necrosis. Several high profile studies have demonstrated that aggressive early fluid resuscitation on the order of 3.4-4.6 liters in the first 24 hours, particularly using lactated ringers is associated with significantly reduced mortality. In a well done retrospective study Reddy et al demonstrated that patients at high risk for post ERCP pancreatitis (and those with early signs) managed with an aggressive fluid resuscitation protocol (defined as D5 ½ NS at 200cc/hour IV) had a significantly improved clinical course compared to those who were not managed according to the protocol.12 Among those high risk patients who were managed according to protocol only 12.5% developed moderate or severe pancreatitis, compared to 61.6% who were not managed according to the protocol. The respective median lengths of hospitalization were 3 days compared to 7 days. In the proposed study our intervention is to prophylactically treat a random group of patients undergoing ERCP with the standard therapy for post ERCP pancreatitis, fluids, in an effort to prevent its development. As a safeguard at 2 hours after the procedure (when the anesthesia from the procedure has typically cleared) any patient who has evidence of pancreatitis is crossed over into the treatment arm. The major potential adverse outcome which could be associated with the therapy is clinical fluid overload as manifested as chest pain, dyspnea or hypoxia as well as pleural effusion, peripheral edema, ascites, anasarca, or pulmonary edema. We will assess the patients for these potential complications and treat them accordingly. The goal for this pilot study is to analyze the efficacy of aggressive hydration in preventing post ERCP pancreatitis. Our hope is to stimulate interest in this topic and clarify if it could possibly lead to a large-scale study in the near future. 2.0 OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE The primary treatment for pancreatitis regardless of the etiology is aggressive fluid resuscitation. Our long-standing aim is to determine whether aggressive intravenous hydration during and immediately after ERCP decreases the incidence of post ERCP pancreatitis. The aim of the current study is to determine how large the effect will be to appropriately power a larger randomized trial. 3.0 STUDY DESIGN The study will be a prospective single blind randomized controlled trial consisting of 60 patients who will undergo ERCP at the LAC+USC Medical Center for standard indications. Patients will be randomly assigned using a computer generated randomization schedule, 40 will be allocated to the treatment (aggressive intravenous hydration) and 20 will be allocated to standard care. This will allow us to examine whether the rate of pancreatitis under usual care is similar to published rates (about 15%), and also allow us greater ability to detect decreases in that rate attributable to the treatment in our small pilot sample. We defined aggressive intravenous hydration as lactated ringers (LR) IV at 3 mL kg-1 hr-1 during the procedure, with 20cc/kg LR IV bolus immediately afterward, and LR IV at 3 mL kg-1 hr-1 x 8 hours. Those in the control arm will receive standard fluids which we define as LR at 1.5 mL kg-1 hr-1 and for 8 hours afterwards Once the patients begin receiving the fluids, volume status will be monitored to assess for any signs of fluid overload or deficits that will require an adjustment to the fluid resuscitation rates. Imbalances in volume status will be monitored clinically by assessing for tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension based on blood pressure measurements, pulmonary and peripheral edema. Based on the hydration status, adjustments will be made accordingly to the fluid resuscitation rates to correct the underlying problem. Numerous studies have attempted to investigate the best test available to assess for post-ERCP pancreatitis, since solely relying on clinical presentation is unreliable. Amylase levels have emerged as a reliable indicator of post-ERCP pancreatitis as lipase usually rises later in pancreatitis and as a result may not be as useful in the early prediction of post-ERCP pancreatitis.13 In our study, the patients will be assessed at 2 hours and 8 hours after the procedure for epigastric pain and an amylase will be sent. Epigastric pain will be assessed using a Likert scale in which 10 is the most severe pain, 0 is no pain, and a value of greater than 3 signifies moderate or greater pain. A cutoff greater than 3 is used in an effort not to include patients with mild transient discomfort due to retained air after endoscopy. The primary outcome measure for post ERCP pancreatitis will be based on if the patients have significant epigastric pain and amylase greater than three times the upper limit of normal. Those in the control group who develop pancreatitis will be given a 20cc/kg LR IV bolus and treated with LR at 3cc/kg/hour. Patients who develop pancreatitis will be fasted and otherwise the patients will be started on clears and subsequently their diet will be advanced as tolerated. Patients who develop pancreatitis will be followed twice daily until discharge in order to define whether the episodes were mild (2-3 days hospitalization), moderate (4-10 days of hospitalization), or severe (>10 days hospitalization or complications including hemorrhagic pancreatitis, pseudocyst, phlegmon, or requiring percutaneous or surgical procedure). 4.0 SELECTION AND WITHDRAWAL OF SUBJECTS SEE ELIGIBILIBILITY SECTION 5.0 STUDY AGENT ADMINISTRATION OR INTERVENTION AND TOXICITY MANAGEMENT PLAN 1.

Patients will be interviewed and examined for symptoms and signs that may suggest this adverse reaction including chest pain, dyspnea or hypoxia as well as pleural effusion, peripheral edema, ascites, anasarca, or pulmonary edema. All adverse events will be reported to the principal investigator. These include event which occur during the initial 24 hour of the procedure and at any time afterward. The entire study team will meet to report adverse events on a biweekly basis. Reports of fluid overload will be submitted to the IRB. Adverse events which occur during the trial will also be reviewed with another faculty physician in the Gastroenterology Division. 7.0 CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION AND ENDPOINT DEFINITIONS SEE ENDPOINTS SECTION 8.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS We are performing a single blind randomized study of aggressive versus standard fluids to prevent post ERCP pancreatitis. While our long term goal is to assess whether prophylactically treating patients undergoing ERCP with aggressive hydration will decrease the incidence of post ERCP pancreatitis our current goal is to assess whether the study is feasible and to assess how large the effect will be. Patients allocated to standard care will be used to test this rate in our sample population. The primary outcome of pancreatitis development within 8 hours of ERCP will be tested using Fisher's exact chi-squared to compare the rate of pancreatitis between groups. Results from this test will allow for estimation of sample size for a fully powered clinical trial. This same method will be used to test the secondary aim of when pancreatitis was first detected (2 hours vs 8 hours), though given the small number of participants who will likely develop pancreatitis (< 15%) the primary aim of this comparison is to inform on monitoring and safety for a fully powered trial. To test the secondary outcome of pain, a repeated measures ANOVA will be used to compare pain ratings between groups at 2 and 8 hours. Because this is a pilot study, the primary aim is to detect effect sizes and clinical relevance of outcomes.. Statistical analyses will be performed by biostatisticians at the Biostatistical and Bioinformatics Resource Group within the SC CTSI.\",\n",

       "  \"The current study is running alongside an externally funded project measuring physical activity levels in patients with bronchiectasis (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT01569009). In order to more fully understand physical activity behaviours in bronchiectasis, it is important to compare the patterns of physical activity, exercise capacity and quality of life of the patients with bronchiectasis to a healthy age-matched population. For a healthy population of similar age to patients with bronchiectasis, little applicable research currently exists with regard to normative values of physical activity and sedentary behaviour. In this particular study, we will measure physical activity levels in healthy individuals age-matched to patients with bronchiectasis. The most commonly used questionnaire to assess physical activity is the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Pedometers are inexpensive devices which can be used to assess daily step count and time spent in walking. Activity monitors are more expensive and require technical expertise for analysis and interpretation. However, they provide more in-depth information on pattern, quantity and intensity of activity including daily sedentary time. In this study, the investigators will use the ActiGraph activity monitor, ActivPAL activity monitor, DigiWalker pedometer and IPAQ to measure the physical activity levels in healthy individuals age-matched to patients with bronchiectasis. This study will not focus on participants who engage in high levels of physical activity as they are unlikely to represent the physical activity levels of patients with bronchiectasis. This study will include the Modified Shuttle Test. Exercise capacity measured by the Modified Shuttle Test is normally only utilized in respiratory disease populations such as patients with cystic fibrosis. However, it has recently been highlighted that there is a need for reference data in healthy populations. This study will also use the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire to assess quality of life. Preliminary testing of the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire, an update to the well-researched EQ-5D-3L, has only recently been conducted. There is a need for studies to provide more normative data on the EQ-5D-5L. This study will also assess readiness to change physical activity behaviour in a healthy population utilising transtheoretical model components such as stages of change, self-efficacy, decisional balance and processes of change; which have all been shown to be important in physical activity behaviour. Understanding healthy individuals' perspectives on readiness to change physical activity behaviour and the links between important outcomes will help to inform future physical activity interventions.\",\n",

       "  'The purpose of this study is to evaluate the role of endotracheal suction on the occurrence of meconium aspiration syndrome in depressed meconium stained babies. Meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS) is believed to result from aspiration of meconium and consequent chemical pneumonitis. Meconium can be aspirated into the lungs in the womb as well. Meconium in the distal airways is not accessible to endotracheal (ET) suction which clears only the windpipe. Furthermore there is growing evidence in support of asphyxia-hypoxia-acidosis in the causation of lung disease. Moreover, in the absence of a clear role of ET suction in depressed meconium stained newborns, critical time could be lost in assessment, intubation and ET suction (range: 30 seconds to 1 min) which might delay the definitive step of ventilation for resuscitation of such babies that can potentially affect the outcome adversely.The utility or futility of endotracheal suction in preventing MAS in depressed meconium stained neonates has not been systematically studied and there is inadequate information in literature in favor or against this practice.Thus this study is an attempt to evaluate the effect of endotracheal suction on the occurrence of MAS in depressed full term neonates born through meconium stained amniotic fluid (MSAF).',\n",
       "  \"Approximately 10-15% of deliveries are complicated by the passage of meconium around the time of delivery.An adverse intrauterine environment with resultant fetal asphyxia is proposed as the most common explanation for in-utero passage of meconium. Aspiration of meconium into the tracheo-bronchial tree with the onset of respiration results in meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS). MAS is defined as respiratory distress in an infant born through MSAF with compatible chest x-ray findings whose symptoms cannot be otherwise explained. Despite current interventions such as intubation and tracheal suction, it is estimated that 5-20 % of infants born through MSAF develop MAS. It represents a leading cause of perinatal morbidity. Approximately 50% of the infants with MAS require mechanical ventilation; 15%-30% develop pulmonary air leaks and 5%-12% die. There are various proposed mechanisms by which meconium causes lung injury, some of the important ones being - Mechanical obstruction of airways - Chemical pneumonitis - Vasoconstriction of pulmonary vessels - Inactivation of surfactant - Activation of compliment Finding of meconium below cords or in the trachea has been shown to be associated with development of MAS. This resulted in use of endotracheal suction along with oro-nasopharyngeal suctioning in all infants born to mothers with MSAF prior to the year 2000. Although, a number of studies performed did not show reduction in incidence of MAS and/or mortality even after performing oro-nasopharyngeal and endotracheal suction, the practice was continued due to lack of robust evidence. Subsequently, as a result of well performed randomized controlled trials and systematic review showing no effect of oro-nasopharyngeal suctioning on occurrence of MAS, this practice has been abandoned since the year 2005. ET suction is currently performed in depressed meconium stained neonates with the idea of removing meconium from the upper airways to relieve mechanical obstruction and to prevent subsequent development of chemical pneumonitis. Since meconium aspiration can occur in-utero as well and with time the aspirated meconium migrates peripherally, the effectiveness of ET suction post-delivery in clearing the airway is not clear. Furthermore, accumulating evidence points to potential role of hypoxia-asphyxia-acidosis with concomitant presence of meconium in the pathogenesis of lung disease. Current practice of Endotracheal suctioning in non-vigorous babies has not been systematically evaluated, till date. No studies have compared the incidence, severity and outcomes of MAS in 'suctioned versus non-suctioned' non vigorous meconium stained neonates. In addition, the procedure needs expertise to be completed in the stipulated time and has potential for complications like vocal cord injury, laryngeal edema, bleeding from upper airway secondary to trauma during the procedure and persistent hoarseness of voice even at six months of age. The rate of complications is more when performed by people with lesser expertise as this is a difficult skill to learn and master. In view of the foregoing the contribution of endotracheal suction in preventing MAS and its effect on severity of lung disease is not clear. Thus this study is an attempt to evaluate the role of endotracheal suction in non-vigorous meconium stained neonates.\",\n",

       "  \"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor neuron loss. Despite of many trials for disease-modifying, no treatment has so far changed natural course of disease. The investigators had performed the pre-clinical and clinical studies using autologous bone marrow-derived stem cells in ALS. In the investigators' results of clinical trial, intrathecal injection of autologous bone marrow-derived stem cells is safe and could slow down disease progression and might be used as a disease modifying strategy in patients with ALS. In the new field, like cell therapy, it is an important issue whether a bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells can be used as an allograft. Many investigators had showed that the immunoprivileged and immunosuppressive properties of mesenchymal stem cells result from the absence of major histocompatibility class II antigens and the secretion of T helper type 2 cytokines. One potential advantage of allogenic bone marrow derived cells could be avoiding the need for procedural delay before treatment. And it is also hypothesized that the function of autologous bone marrow derived cells could be impaired in patients with co-morbidities or advanced age.

And currently, it is the fifth chief cause of death in the United State of America. COPD is characterized by chronic, irreversible inflammation of the airways and has two pathologic features, emphysema and bronchiolitis. The most relevant feature in the lung emphysema is airflow limitation, resulting from the loss of alveolar wall and enlargement of alveolar space distal to the terminal bronchiole. Cigarette and air pollution are the most major factors for developing COPD. Unfortunately, aside from supplemental domiciliary oxygen for the small number of patients who demonstrate resting arterial hypoxemia and smoking cessation for continued smokers, there are no interventions that have been unequivocally shown to prolong survival in patients with COPD.

Respiratory complications due to respiratory muscle weakness are common in the terminal stages of MS and contribute to mortality in these patients. Respiratory muscle weakness may also impair the performance of coughing and aspiration, pneumonia, or even acute ventilatory failure may ensue. Functional magnetic stimulation (FMS) is a non-invasive method that promotes the contraction of muscles through nerve activation. Over the last few years, the study investigators have demonstrated efficacy of FMS technology for stimulating respiratory muscles in animal models, able-bodied subjects [3] and spinal cord injured (SCI) patients [4]. In this study, the researchers will investigate the efficacy of using FMS technique for respiratory muscle conditioning in patients with MS. Furthermore, the investigators will also compare expiration related outcomes of FMS technique with resistive expiratory muscle training (REMT) methodology. Hypotheses 1. FMS conditioning of the expiratory muscles can generate significant expiratory flows and pressures in patients with MS. 2. FMS conditioning of expiratory muscles is more effective compared to resistive expiratory muscle training (REMT) in patients with MS.',\n",
       "  \"Optimal respiratory function depends on intact neural circuitry which orchestrates the interplay between respiratory muscles and intrinsic pulmonary function to maintain adequate ventilation. In the absence of respiratory muscle activation, pressure gradients cannot be developed and air exchange at the alveolar surface cannot occur. Thus, any impairment in respiratory muscle performance can lead to pulmonary dysfunction, respiratory distress and even death. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a primary disorder of the central nervous system that often affects motor pathways, causing diminished muscle strength and endurance throughout the body including the ventilatory muscles. Respiratory complications are recognized as the major cause of morbidity and mortality in individuals with advanced MS. The investigators' research team has over 15 years of experience using Functional Magnetic Stimulation (FMS) for stimulating nerves and muscles below the level of injury in patients with chronic SCI; and has also demonstrated significant benefit for improving respiratory muscles, bladder and bowel functions. In this study, the investigators will investigate the efficacy of using FMS technique for respiratory muscle conditioning in patients with multiple sclerosis; and will compare the results of the expired functions (volume, pressure, and flow) generated by using the FMS technique with data obtained from using the resistive expiratory muscle training (REMT) methodology.\",\n",

       "  \"The patients were chosen from a main population of 3000 females in the child bearing period (18-40 years), with a bileaflet mechanical mitral (+ aortic) valve prosthesis, on regular follow-up at the outpatient clinic of Ain Shams University Hospitals. Patients were primarily screened for their wiliness to participate in the study by expressing their clear wish to become pregnant (Subpopulation A: 310 patients) or otherwise making a clear decision of not becoming pregnant by following a regular contraceptive measure (Subpopulation B: 660 patients). Study groups A (pregnant) and B (non-pregnant) were then created by assessing the respective subpopulations for the following eligibility criteria (a) regular menstrual cycles and no history of congenital malformation, repeated abortions or still birth; (b) patient in NYHA class I or II c) regular INR records for the last 3 months, with the target INR being achieved with warfarin not exceeding 10 mg/day; d) patient accepting to participate in the study and; (d) getting pregnant for Group A patients, of course Patients were excluded from either groups if they refuse to participate in the study or to sign the informed consent. Pregnant patients were excluded from Group A if reporting their missed menstrual period or positive pregnancy test later than the 6th week of gestation. Patients were excluded from Group B whenever they get pregnant, of course. A total of 100 patients were intended to be recruited in each group. Out of the 104 patients who met the inclusion criteria of Group A, 4 cases were excluded for reporting pregnancy late at the 9th and 12th week (2 cases; 1.9%) and for refusing to sign the informed consent (2 cases; 1.9%). Out of the 135 patients who met the inclusion criteria of Group B, as much as 35 patients (25.9%) were excluded for refusing to participate in the study. Randomization and treatment allocation: In order to become a formal Group A member, patients in subpopulation A were followed up until conception, with clear instructions to report after 3 days of missing a menstrual period and to confirm pregnancy by repeatedly performing pregnancy test every 3 days or until menstruating. Legible patients of both groups had to sign the informed consent before being randomized. We have used a simple 8 elements randomization table, with 6 elements being assigned to warfarin and 2 elements being assigned to phenindione, to create 2 separate randomization lists. Each list was used to randomize the recruited 100 patients of each group to either: low dose warfarin (<5 mg/day) or phenindione (<100 mg/day), in a 3:1 ratio; respectively. In patients assigned to the latter, phenindione replaced warfarin with a starting dose of 50 mg/day (25 mg /day in patients weighing <40 kg.), INR was repeated after 4 days and the dose was adjusted accordingly. All patients targeted an INR between 2.5 and 3.5. Follow-up: Patients were followed up till delivery (Group A) or for a whole 9 month's period (Group B). During that time, patients benefited from a monthly cardiac examination, bimonthly checks up for hepatorenal functions and complete blood picture as well as echocardiographic examination. In addition, Group A patients benefited from a monthly obstetrical examination and sonography. All patients were instructed to report any complication immediately and, in Group A, all prescribed drugs were revised by attending obstetrician. Prothrombin time (PT) was done on DADE BEHRING CA 1500 and INR was checked out the day of randomization, after 4 days, 2 weeks and then regularly on a monthly basis. Starting the second trimester (Group A) or the fourth month of follow-up (Group B), 100 mg aspirin was added to all cases. Patients presenting with an INR <20% target were subjected to clinical examination with special emphasis on dietary / bowel habits, recently received medication and INR was repeated 4 days after managing any suspected cause. Patients still failing to reach lower target as well as those initially presenting with an INR below 2 were shifted to the other oral anticoagulant. The starting dose of the latter was calculated on the basis that the anticoagulation effect of 1 mg of warfarin is roughly equivalent to that achieved with 10 mg of phenindione (unpublished experience). In between shifts, the INR gap was bridged with LMWH 1 mg/kg, given twice daily. Patients failing to reach lower INR target with the maximum allowed daily dose of both oral anticoagulants were excluded from the study. Fortnight before delivery, Group A patients were hospitalized and the oral anticoagulant was substituted with continuous infusion of UFH and a planned delivery at 36th week per vagina or by Caesarian section, as indicated.\",\n",

       "  'The recently published Carotid Occlusion Surgery Study (COSS) failed to show a benefit of extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass surgery over medical therapy in patients with symptomatic hemodynamically significant carotid occlusion. Since then on, different controversies have been raised on several aspects including the study population, qualifications of surgeons and hemodynamic evaluation. In COSS protocol, the primary inclusion population is the patient demonstrating occlusion of unilateral ICA while the contralateral ICA less than 50% stenosis. Because of the enrollment problems, in the final result report, 18% patients suffered from contralateral ICA stenosis more than 50%. As we known, COSS utilized oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) ratio by PET as the criterion of hemodynamic evaluation. Bilateral ICAs lesion will disturbed the ratio even the identifying the subgroup of patients with hemodynamic insufficiency. As an interventional trial, the COSS should ensure the certification for the experienced surgeons. While for expanding the number of centers and enhancing recruitment, COSS made some concessions on the surgeons training and certification. The 15% postoperative event rate is not the best that can be achieved according to recent surgical technical development. The cerebral hemodynamic insufficiency has been considered as the primary pathophysiological factor for patients with ICA or MCA occlusion. For these patients, antiplatelet therapy is not likely to prevent hemodynamic stroke.EC-IC bypass surgery probably will be the possible effective therapy. These underlying assumptions deserved further exploration and more strict research.So the CMOSS study in China is designed to compare the efficacy and safety of EC-IC bypass surgery with medical therapy in patients with symptomatic hemodynamically significant carotid occlusion.',\n",

The results of this study should help to better understand important aspects of biliary RFA which may positively influence future applications of this method.',\n",
       "  'Introduction Biliary obstruction is the most relevant life limiting factor in patients suffering from primary or secondary bile duct malignancies. Underlying tumors, such as extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (CCa) of Klatskin type, pancreatic adenocarcinoma or metastases of colorectal cancer, are often diagnosed at an advanced stage when presenting with biliary obstruction. This mostly restricts treatment strategies to palliative management. Within this setting the prevention of biliary complications like jaundice, cholangitis or cholangiosepsis is one of the therapeutic key factors to extend survival and maintain quality of life [De Groen, Skipworth]. Endoscopic stenting of the biliary tract is an easy and safe approach to restore biliary drainage [Smith]. Self-expanding metal stents are preferred to plastic stents because of the lower risk of stent occlusion [Kaassis, Soderlund]. In addition to stenting endoscopic therapies that directly affect the local tumor mass, have been developed within the past years. First of all, photodynamic therapy using different photosensitizers has shown promising results for the reduction of tumor size and maintenance of biliary drainage [Ortner, Zoepf]. However, the patient management for this treatment involving peri-interventional photosensitivity remains cumbersome. Recently, an endoscopically applicable radiofrequency catheter for the biliary tract, the so called HabibTM EndoHBP catheter, was introduced into the market. It uses bipolar electrical energy for tissue coagulation and can be applied without any special patient preparation in the context of an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) examination. RFA is well known from transcutaneous applications, where it already proved to be effective as a treatment option for hepatocellular carcinoma or intrahepatic CCa [Minami]. The new HabibTM EndoHBP catheter was already evaluated ex vivo [Itoi] and showed promising results concerning safety and prevention of stent occlusion in the context of one small retrospective clinical study [Steel]. Primary objective Feasibility and safety of endoscopic radiofrequency ablation with the HabibTM EndoHBP catheter for the treatment of malignant biliary obstruction Study Design Retrospective analysis of prospectively gained clinical data Primary endpoint Technical failures during the RFA procedure Secondary endpoints 1. Complications during the RFA procedure 2. Hospital stay 3. Adverse events during hospital stay and unil first clinical control after discharge (an expected average of 4 weeks after RFA procedure) 4. 30-day and 90-day mortality Study Population All patients who underwent endoscopic radiofrequency ablation with the HabibTM EndoHBP as a treatment for malignant biliary obstruction between November 2010 and December 2012 in Austria. Methods Endoscopic examination report databases will be screened for \"radiofrequency ablation\" in the context of an \"endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography\" to identify the mentioned study population. Examination reports, discharge letters and patient curves of the study patients will be screened to yield the following parameters: - Demographics - Sex - Age at first RFA-intervention - Underlying disease that led to malignant biliary obstruction - Type of underlying disease - Time from diagnosis to first RFA-intervention - Previous treatment attempts (chemotherapy, radiation therapy, photodynamic therapy) - Procedure related parameters - Prior biliary stents (type, amount) - Date of RFA procedure - Amount of RFA-applications during the procedure (energy, time) - Technical failure of the RFA catheter during the RFA procedure (defined as any technical problem that hinders the satisfactory application of RFA) - Complications during the RFA procedure (defined as any adverse change from the subject\\'s baseline condition, i.e. any unfavorable and unintended sign including an abnormal laboratory finding, symptom or disease which is considered to be clinically relevant by the physician, whether or not considered related to the medical device) - Stenting after the procedure (type, amount) - Post-interventional parameters - Days of hospitalization after the RFA procedure - Adverse events during hospital stay and until first clinical control after discharge (an expected average of 4 weeks after RFA procedure) defined as any adverse change from the subject\\'s baseline condition, i.e. any unfavorable and unintended sign including an abnormal laboratory finding, symptom or disease which is considered to be clinically relevant by the physician, whether or not considered related to the medical device - Survial status (dead/alive) at the time of the data collection - (Cause of death) - (Time between first RFA procedure and death) Data processing will be done after pseudonymization using continuous patient identification numbers. All parameters will be assessed descriptively. For scaled parameters (e.g. age) median and range will be calculated, for nominal parameters (e.g. type of underlying disease) the proportions of sub-items will be reported. Mortality will be assessed creating a Kaplan Meyer curve. 30-day and 90-day mortality will be extrapolated from this curve. All data processing will be done with SPSS 19.0. Risk/Benefit assessment Due to its retrospective design this study does not inherit any risk for the study patients.

       "  'The relationship between obesity and breast cancer is a complex one. Obesity is a risk factor for the development of breast cancer in postmenopausal women and has been linked to an increased risk of recurrence and decreased survival as compared to patients with normal weight. The hypothesis that led to this study is that the amount of total-body aromatization capacity indicated by body mass index (BMI). In postmenopausal women and in premenopausal women with ovarian suppression, the major source of serum estrogens is the fat tissue, in which precursors are metabolized to estrogens by the enzyme aromatase. Thus, an increase in BMI leads to an increase in total-body aromatization and, consequently, an increase in oestrogen serum levels, which impact on breast cancer. Taken together, this suggests that BMI may serve as a useful surrogate parameter for total-body aromatization and eventually may be a practicable tool to tailor aromatase inhibitors (AIs) therapy for individual patients. The study will include 360, postmenopausal patients with early breast cancer who have hormones receptor positive tumour as defined by the expression of oestrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone receptor (PR). Patients will be randomly assigned to receive tamoxifen 20 mg once daily or AIs (letrozole 2.5mg/ anastrozole 1mg/exemestane 25mg) once daily for five years. Patients with a tumour stage IB, IC, or II irrespective of nodal stage (<10 positive nodes) will be included. Weight and height will be taken at baseline for calculation of BMI according to the WHO criteria. The frequency of adverse events will be used to assess safety throughout the study. The primary end point will be disease-free survival (DFS). Secondary end points will be recurrence-free survival and overall survival (OS). The data will be analyzed for DFS and OS according to the BMI subgroups as well as two treatment arms (tamoxifen v AIs). The frequency of adverse events will be used to assess safety throughout the study.',\n",

       "  'The main purpose of this study is to examine the outcome of a combined bone marrow and kidney transplant from a partially matched related (haploidentical or \"haplo\") donor. This is a pilot study, you are being asked to participate because you have a blood disorder and kidney disease. The aim of the combined transplant is to treat both your underlying blood disorder and kidney disease. We expect to have about 10 people participate in this study. Additionally, because the same person who is donating the kidney will also be donating the bone marrow, there may be a smaller chance of kidney rejection and less need for long-term use of anti-rejection drugs. Traditionally, very strong cancer treatment drugs (chemotherapy) and radiation are used to prepare a subject\\'s body for bone marrow transplant. This is associated with a high risk for serious complications, even in subjects without kidney disease. This therapy can be toxic to the liver, lungs, mucous membranes, and intestines. Additionally, it is believed that standard therapy may be associated with a higher risk of a complication called graft versus host disease (GVHD) where the new donor cells attack the recipient\\'s normal body. Recently, less intense chemotherapy and radiation regimens have been employed (these are called reduced intensity regimens) which cause less injury and GVHD to patients, and thus, have allowed older and less healthy patients to undergo bone marrow transplant. In this study, a reduced intensity regimen of chemotherapy and radiation will be used with the intent of producing fewer toxicities than standard therapy. Typical therapy following a standard kidney transplant includes multiple lifelong medications that aim to prevent the recipient\\'s body from attacking or rejecting the donated kidney. These are called immunosuppressant drugs and they work by \"quieting\" the recipient\\'s immune system to allow the donated kidney to function properly. One goal in our study is to decrease the duration you will need to be on immunosuppressant drugs following your kidney transplant as the bone marrow transplant will provide you with the donor\\'s immune system which should not attack the donor kidney.',\n",

       "  'Obesity-induced chronic inflammation is a key component of the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. Mounting evidence has demonstrated anti-inflammatory characteristics for vitamin D. Although analogues of vitamin D3 have extensively been used in the treatment of various chronic inflammatory diseases, to our knowledge, no such research is conducted in regards with obesity. The aim of this double blind clinical trial study is to investigate whether alphacalcidol treatment in obese subjects can affect the insulin resistance. Moreover, we will evaluate the pathways of Vitamin D receptor (VDR), Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and eroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- coactivator-1 α (PGC1α) gene expressions which may lead to insulin resistance following treatment with either alphacalcidol or placebo.',\n",
       "  'Increasing evidence from human population studies and animal research has established correlative as well as causative links between chronic inflammation and insulin resistance. The anti-inflammatory characteristics of vitamin D have been demonstrated in previous studies. In addition to its role in bone and calcium metabolism, vitamin D is demonstrated to be influential in the regulation of different immune system functions and glucose homeostasis pathways. Although low levels of vitamin D have shown to be in close correlation with obesity, whether vitamin D deficiency is the cause or the consequence of obesity remains unclear. It is noteworthy that several studies have demonstrated that vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increased resistance to insulin. The biologic effects of vitamin D are primarily mediated via the nuclear transcription factor, vitamin D receptor (VDR), which triggers the expression of vitamin D responsive genes. VDR is expressed on different immune cells such as monocytes, T-lymphocytes, and granulocytes. It is documented that VDR and PGC-1α show an overlapping pattern of expression. Furthermore, as the expression of PGC-1α and PPARγ are regulated via environmental stimuli such as diet, it could be suggested that the function of VDR function can also be altered in response to external stimuli. PGC-1α was demonstrated to be of a particular importance in amelioration of increased insulin sensitivity. Accordingly, to evaluate whether alphacalcidol treatment in obese subjects who generally suffer from a low state chronic inflammation could affect the insulin resistance, we designed the current double blind clinical trial study to compare the effect of alfacalcidol with placebo on serum glucose, 25-OH vitamin D, PTH, and lipid profile levels as well as Homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) indexes as a markers of insulin resistance. Furthermore, to assess the possible cross talk between VDR and PPARγ, the gene expressions of these VDR, PPARγ and PGC1α were evaluated following a course of treatment with either alphacalcidol or placebo.',\n",

       "  'A wide spectrum of immune abnormalities has been described by numerous studies involving β-thalassemic patients with multiple transfusions. The abnormalities observed are both quantitative and functional, and concern several components of the immune response. Flavonoids are phenolic compounds widely distributed in plants, which were reported to exert multiple biological effects, including antioxidant and free radical scavenging abilities. Silymarin, a flavonolignan complex isolated from milk thistle (Silybum marianum L. Gaertn), have been classified as cytoprotective, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and especially as hepatoprotective agents. Silymarin is already being used clinically for treatment of liver diseases.It is considered safe and well-tolerated, with reported adverse events similar to placebo. Several studies have also reported immunomodulatory actions of silymarin. It increases lymphocyte proliferation, interferon gamma, interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-10 secretions by stimulated lymphocytes in a dose-dependent manner. It has been shown that in vitro treatment of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with silymarin causes restoration of the thiol status and increases in T cell proliferation and activation. Because reactive oxygen species and iron overload play important roles in the pathophysiology of thalassemia, silymarin may be an effective therapy due to its antioxidant, immunomodulatory, cytoprotective and iron chelating activities. The present study designed to investigate the therapeutic activity of orally administered silymarin for treatment of β-thalassemia major, a well-known and prevalent disease in Iran, which is associated with oxidative stress, iron overload and immune abnormalities.',\n",

This application proposes to test a theory-based behavioral intervention to simultaneously improve HIV treatment adherence and reduce HIV transmission risk behaviors in people living with HIV/AIDS who use alcohol and other drugs. Grounded in Conflict Theory of Decision Making, the intervention will be delivered in a mixed format, with one office-based counseling session followed by four cell phone delivered counseling sessions.

Men (n = 250) and women (n = 250) receiving HIV treatment will be recruited from AIDS services and infectious disease clinics. Following informed consent and baseline assessments, participants will be randomly assigned to either an (a) integrated HIV treatment adherence - risk reduction intervention or (b) a time-matched non-contaminating attention control condition. Participants will be followed for 12-months using office-based computerized interviews, unannounced pill counts, and medical chart abstraction. The study will test the hypothesis that a unified, integrated theory-based HIV treatment and risk reduction intervention will reduce HIV transmission risk behaviors, improve HIV treatment adherence, reduce viral load and prevent new STI. The study will also examine the influence of theoretical constructs and structural barriers on intervention outcomes. Factors that predict relapse to non-adherence and risk behaviors in relation to changes in viral load and STI over the 12-month follow-up period will also be a focal point of the study.

       "  'The laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LAGB) is a safe and effective surgical intervention for chronically obese patients who have exhausted all non-surgical weight loss treatments. Numerous published studies have confirmed both the safety and efficacy of the LAGB and its beneficial impact on obesity-associated conditions, such as type 2 diabetes, joint and back pain and hypertension. The A.M.I. Protector Band is a modification of an existing gastric band (the A.M.I. Soft Gastric Band) which has been in use since 2001 and which has been shown to be both safe and effective. The specific design modification is in the form of a section of mesh, which provides support to the gastric pouch and which further restricts food portion sizes. The expectation is that this will deliver optimal weight loss whilst having the maximum possible impact on obesity-associated conditions such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. In the longer term, there is also the possibility that the Protector Band will reduce the incidence of band complications such as slippage and dilatation (or stretching) of the gastric pouch. In this study we will recruit approximately 200 patients who will then undergo surgical implantation of the A.M.I. Protector Band. The study participants will then be followed for a period of 3-years, during which time we will record weight loss, changes in co-morbid conditions such as diabetes and the incidence of band complications, including slippage and pouch dilatation.',\n",
       "  \"Where patients express an interest in the A.M.I. Protector Band, they will be given a Patient Information Sheet which will form the basis of a discussion with the attending physician. Patients opting for the Protector Band will be told that their anonymised clinical data will be stored in a secure database and used for research purposes. They will also be required to attend for regular follow-up (see below) for a period of three years after implantation. Following this initial consultation, a minimum period of 2-weeks will be required before the patient is listed for surgery. This will provide a suitable period during which the patient can consider the options and seek clarification on any points about which they are unclear. In the case of the A.M.I. Protector Band the surgery will be performed in two locations: - Spire Hospital Parkway (Birmingham) - Spire Hospital Manchester All band procedures will be performed by one of two surgeons; Mr. Paul Super and Prof. Franco Favretti according to a standard protocol. In all cases, informed consent will be obtained prior to surgery. Patients will remain in hospital overnight and be discharged the following day. On discharge, patients will be given comprehensive written instructions regarding optimal nutritional and physical activity. They will also be provided with a 24-hour, Emergency Helpline number in the event of problems. All patients will be followed for a period of three years, with a formal review at 5 weeks and then at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 and 36 months. However, patients will be free to attend additional clinics between the formal reviews should they wish. At each visit the patient's weight, height, waist/hip ratio and blood pressure (BP) will be recorded. In addition, a range of blood tests will be carried out at baseline, at 12, 24 and 36 months.

Tissues obtained will be snap frozen and subsequently analyzed for EF5 binding. Immunohistochemical analysis of a cohort of immunohistochemical and urine markers that depict the HRHV axis will also be examined. The association of the markers with the presence of hypoxia, as determined by EF5 positivity, will be determined.

The extent to which acoustical-motor entrainment can induce longer-term changes to physical activity behaviours remains unclear. Cardiac rehabilitation is essential and is associated with irrefutable mortality benefits for patients following an acute cardiac event. Randomized clinical trials have demonstrated a 25-50% improvement in survival as compared to controls; however, as many as 50% of patients will dropout of such programs prior to completion, which undermines these morbidity and mortality benefits (37; 54). Research exploring ways to improve compliance to such programs has suggested that the incorporation of music and other such holistic, patient-centered interventions into a rehabilitation/exercise program is associated with improved motivation, endurance and satisfaction amongst cardiac rehabilitation participants. The MAINTAIN study has been designed to conduct a feasibility evaluation on the effects of a preference-based music intervention on adherence to the cardiac rehabilitation program at Toronto Rehabilitation Institute. The primary objective of the trial is to evaluate the feasibility of the implementation of such a protocol within the context of the program. This is a two-arm, block 2:1 randomized trial. 35 patients participating in cardiac rehabilitation at Toronto Rehabilitation: Cardiac Rehabilitation and Secondary Prevention Program will be recruited and participants will be randomized into: 1) control (standard, usual care); and, 2) music intervention.

All those patients randomized into arm 2 will be equally randomized into either (2) preference-based music intervention, (3) preference-based music enhanced with RAS. The primary outcome measure will be weekly physical activity over a 3 month duration as measured using tri-axial accelerometers. We will also analyze the impact of a preference-based music intervention based on audio playlist utilization, self-reported sitting times ,exercise-times, on-site attendance to the cardiac rehabilitation program (attendance), peak oxygen uptake (VO2) (stress-test), and self-efficacy levels (self-efficacy questionnaires).

       "  \"Background: Acromegaly is a rare disease caused by GH hypersecretion from a pituitary adenoma. The annual incidence is estimated to be 3-5/million with a prevalence of 100 - 150/million. The incidence rate is however uncertain since no nationwide surveys exist. If left untreated or poorly controlled the condition is associated with progressive morbidity and an excess mortality. The primary treatment is surgery, which however only provides a cure rate of ≈ 50 -60% due to the size of the tumour. The second line treatment today is medical treatment with slow release formulations of somatostatin analogs (SA) and, more recently, a specific GH antagonist. Accurate data on incidence rates and outcome of treatment are of obvious importance in order to provide optimal and evidence-based treatment for the disease. This is particularly relevant in light of the availability of new and effective treatment modalities such as the GH antagonist, the proper place of which in the treatment algorithm still remains controversial. Denmark holds a unique position in terms of epidemiological studies due to the existence of well organized databases which include all its inhabitants. A recognised problem with epidemiological surveys from specialised centres is whether the figures are representative for the general population. A nationwide Danish study will profit from the fact that every Danish citizen holds a unique ID number that makes it easy to retrieve and combine pertinent data regarding health, disease and death from different registries. The investigators have previously used this for a landmark survey of another rare endocrine disease, i.e. Cushing's syndrome. This publication has been cited more than 100 times.

The etiology remains elusive, but a genetically determined aberrant immune response against microbiota appears to be responsible. TNFα plays a pivotal role in the cytokine cascade of the inflammatory process and mediates multiple processes central to the pathogenesis of CD. The natural history of pediatric CD is characterized by recurrent flare-ups that severely impair patients growth, pubertal development and nutritional status. Epidemiological observations have shown that the course of CD, despite conventional treatment, inevitably progresses to the development of severe complications and surgery. Infliximab is the most widely used biological agent in moderate-to-severe pediatric CD. At present biologics are used after the failure of conventional drugs (step-up approach) and represent the peak of the CD therapeutic pyramid. The early use of biologics (top-down approach) has been demonstrated to be effective in adults with CD. The project aims at evaluating if a top-down approach may achieve mucosal healing before irreversible tissue damage present in late CD and thus alter the natural course of the disease, compared to the conventional approach. The study can also add information about the safety of infliximab used as first-line therapy and may add data on the benefit and costs of a reversal of the traditional therapeutic pyramid in pediatric CD, guiding the clinician in deciding in whom, when and how to introduce early aggressive treatment in daily practice.\",\n",

Children who will have received any CS within 4 weeks before randomization will be also excluded. Patients who will have received 5-ASA will be eligible if the drug will be kept with a stable regimen for more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the study. Early CD will be arbitrarily defined as disease duration of <1 yr from the time of diagnosis. Eligible patients will be randomly allocated to receive a 8-week course of IFX plus AZA (top-down arm - TD) or CS plus AZA (step-up arm - SU). Randomization group assignments will be generated using a computer-generated randomization schedule by an independent statistician unaware of the patient's clinical history. Patients randomized on TD arm will receive an induction regimen of three consecutive i.v. infusions of IFX (Remicade, 5 mg/kg) at weeks 0, 2, and 6 plus AZA (2 mg/Kg per os/day). During maintaining phase, patients will receive subsequent infusions of IFX (5 mg/kg every 8 weeks), starting 8 weeks after the end of the induction phase (week 14). For each intravenous infusion, IFX will be reconstituted according to the instructions given on the package insert. Patients who will not respond to the induction regimen at week 8 will receive no further treatment with IFX. At 12 months AZA will be discontinued and patients on TD group will continue IFX monotherapy until the end of the study. Patients randomized on SU arm will receive methylprednisolone (1 mg/Kg/day per os. for 2 weeks then tapering of 5 mg/week then stop) plus AZA (2 mg/Kg/die per os/day). During the trial, other drugs will be not allowed, including immunosuppressive agents, other biological agents, other CS, such as budesonide. 5-ASA and sulfasalazine will be allowed, if begun before the enrollment. Disease recurrence will be treated with IFX in the TD group, and with repeated CS in the SU group. Clinical assessment will be performed through PCDAI at baseline, every 4 weeks after starting treatments during the induction, every 8 weeks during the maintaining phase (48 weeks), and every 12 weeks during the follow-up phase. The PCDAI (Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index) is a multi-item score, based on recall of preceding week's symptoms, laboratory parameters (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, haematocrit and albumin), and physical examination score <=10 indicates inactive disease, 10-30 mild disease, and >30 moderate-to-severe disease. Clinical response to treatment require a 25-point decrease in PCDAI score. Clinical remission is defined as the absence of symptoms related to CD and a PCDAI <=10. From each patient blood samples to determine full blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), serological values of albumin, urea, iron, creatinine, electrolytes, pancreatic and liver function tests will be taken before starting the randomization, every 4 weeks during the induction phase, and every 8 weeks during maintaining phase. All patients will undergo ileo-colonoscopy before, 8 weeks (end of the induction phase) and 48 weeks (end of the maintaining phase) after the beginning of the treatments. Endoscopy will be performed with a pediatric endoscope after deep sedation with propofol (induction dose: 1 to 2 mg/kg; repeated dose: 0.5 to 1 mg/kg). Endoscopies will be performed by experienced operators who will be unaware of the patient's clinical history, treatment program and clinical and bioumoral responses to the therapy. During ileo-colonoscopy, at least two biopsy samples will be taken from ileum and from each colonic segment for routine histological assessment. Biopsies will stained with haematoxylin and eosin and read by experienced gastrointestinal pathologists, unaware both of endoscopic features and clinical history. Mucosal healing will be evaluated through CDEIS (Crohn's Disease Endoscopic Index of Severity). CDEIS is based on the presence, at the level of terminal ileum and colon, of deep or superficial ulcerations, extension of ulcerated surface and presence of ulcerated or nonulcerated stenosis. Histological evaluation will be done by a scoring system previously validated used for ileal and colonic histology, combining both acute changes (infiltration of mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cells, erosions ulcerations) and chronic changes involving the mucosal architecture. The final histological colonic score will be obtained by the mean of the scores of each of the colonic segments.\",\n",

       "  'Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a hereditary vascular condition characterized by the development of abnormal connections between arteries and veins throughout the body, called vascular malformations. These abnormal blood vessels are referred to as arteriovenous malformations (AVM) if they are large and telangiectasias if they are small. Telangiectasias develop due to irregular growth of blood vessels. Anti-angiogenic therapy, such as the drug Apo-Timop, curbs the growth of new blood vessels. Apo-Timop is included in a class of medications called beta-blockers. Anti-angiogenic therapies exert their beneficial effects in a number of ways: by disabling the agents that activate and promote cell growth, or by directly blocking the growing blood vessel cells. The investigators think that anti-angiogenic therapy may lead to the shrinking of telangiectasia in people with HHT. The investigators hope that this study will provide us with proof of this concept and might lead to the development and study of anti-angiogenic therapies to help improve the lives of individuals with vascular malformations.',\n",
       "  \"This is a small study of 10 patients from St. Michael's Hospital who have HHT and at least 5 typical telangiectasias. Patients who anticipate a major surgery during this study or are pregnant, breast feeding or on other beta blocker medication may not enroll in this study. This study lasts 12 weeks. During this time, subjects will apply a drop of either Apo-timop 0.5% or a placebo solution to 4 telangiectasias twice daily. The active study medication is called Apo-Timop and is a clear liquid solution stored in a bottle. An eye dropper is used for application. - Apo-timop will be applied to 3 telangiectasias and - a placebo will be applied to one telangiectasia A placebo is an inactive substance, with no active medication in it, and it looks the same as the real medication. There is no potential harm of receiving the placebo. It is necessary to use a placebo to make sure that the effect of Apo-timop can be determined without any bias. Subjects will receive four numbered bottles for every 28 day period as well as a photo which indicates which bottle is to be applied to which telangiectasia. Neither the subject nor the research staff will know which telangiectasia will receive the placebo. Apo-timop, is not part of the standard therapeutic regimen for HHT. It is a Health Canada approved medication which is applied as an eye drop, that has been shown to reduce pressure in the eye and is commonly used for glaucoma.\",\n",

Cancer cells will be \"labeled\" with heavy water to learn about their birth rates and death rates. Ibrutinib is a type of drug called a kinase inhibitor. Kinases are proteins inside cells that help cells live and grow. The study drug is designed to inhibit or \"block\" the activity of a type of kinase that helps blood-cancer cells live and grow. By blocking the activity of this specific kinase, it is possible that the study drug may kill the cancer cells or stop them from growing.

       "  'Heavy Water Administration: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive heavy water to drink for 4 weeks. The vials of heavy water will be shipped to your home location. On Days 1-5, you will drink the heavy water 3 times each day. You will drink 1 dose in the morning, 1 dose in the afternoon, and 1 dose in the evening. You should take the doses at least 3 hours apart. If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember. Make sure to wait at least 3 hours between doses. Starting on Day 6 and until your first study visit, you will drink the heavy water 1 time each day in the evening. You may choose to drink the heavy water with or without food. You will be given a study diary to record your doses. If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember. If you vomit a dose, you do not need to make it up. Just wait until the next regularly scheduled dose and make a note of it in the diary. Heavy Water Study Visits: On Day 1 and during Weeks 2 and 4, blood (about 5 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and for heavy water testing. These blood samples will not be banked for future research. The samples will only be used for research in this study and will be kept until all DNA and protein analysis is complete. These Samples will be sent to our collaborators at the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research and KineMed, Inc., in order to conduct the heavy water analyses. After Week 4, you will stop drinking the heavy water and will be followed either in the clinic or by your local doctor for 6-12 weeks. Every 2 weeks during the time after you stop drinking heavy water and before you start taking ibrutinib, the following tests and procedures will be performed: - You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs. - Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for heavy water testing. This measures how fast the cancer cells are making new protein and DNA. - You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking. Every 4 weeks during the time after you stop drinking heavy water and before you start taking ibrutinib, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests. Ibrutinib Administration: Beginning around Weeks 10-16, you will start taking ibrutinib. You will take 3 capsules by mouth with 1 cup (8 ounces) of water 1 time a day. The dose should be taken at least 30 minutes before eating and at least 2 hours after a meal, at about the same time each day. If you miss or vomit a dose, do not make up the dose. Take the next dose at your regularly scheduled time and be sure to write it down in the study diary. You will take the study drug for up to 12 cycles. Each cycle is 28 days. If the doctor thinks it is in your best interest, you may continue taking the study drug even after 12 cycles. You will also take allopurinol by mouth 1 time each day during the first 1-2 weeks of taking ibrutinib to lower the risk of side effects. Ibrutinib Study Visits: At every study visit, you will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and about any side effects you may be having. On Days 1 and 3 of Week 1, and at the end of Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10: - You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs. - Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests. - Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for heavy water testing. At the end of Week 12: - You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs. - Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests. - Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for heavy water testing. - You will have computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to check the status of the disease. - You will have a bone marrow aspiration to check the status of the disease. To collect a bone marrow aspirate, an area of the hip or other site is numbed with anesthetic, and a small amount of bone marrow is withdrawn through a large needle. At the end of Weeks 16 and 20: - You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs. - Blood (about 2 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests. At the end of Weeks 24 and 36: - You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs. - Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests. - You will have CT scans to check the status of the disease. - You will have a bone marrow aspiration to check the status of the disease. At the end of Week 48: - You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs. - Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests. - You will have CT scans to check the status of the disease. Length of Study Drug Dosing: You may continue taking the study drug for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions. Your participation on the study will be over after the end-of-study visits. Follow-Up Visits: If you continue taking the study drug past 12 cycles, you will come to the clinic for follow-up visits every month. You will continue to have follow-up visits as long as you are taking the study drug. At each visit, the following tests and procedures will be performed: - You will have a physical exam, including measurement of you vital signs. - Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

       "  'This research study is a Phase II clinical trial, which tests the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific cancer. \"Investigational\" means that the drug is being studied and that research doctors are trying to find out more about it-such as the safest dose to use, the side effects it may cause and if the drug is effective for treating your type of cancer. It also means that the FDA has not yet approved the drug for your type of cancer or for any use outside of research studies. It has been found that some people with NSCLC have a change (mutation) in a certain gene called the ALK gene. This mutated gene helps cancer cells grow. There is a drug (crizotinib) that has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of people with NSCLC who have mutations in the ALK gene. Most people respond to crizotinib initially. Over time, however, patients may stop responding (become resistant) to crizotinib because of additional changes in the ALK gene that makes crizotinib ineffective. AUY922 is an investigational drug that may stop cancer cells from growing abnormally. This drug has been used in other research studies. Information from those other research studies suggests that AUY922 may be effective in killing cancer cells that have become resistant to drugs like crizotinib. Only participants with changes in the ALK gene will be allowed to participate in this study. The purpose of this study is to test the safety of AUY922 and determine how well AUY922 treats participants with advanced, ALK-positive NSCLC.',\n",

A blood pregnancy test, for women who can become pregnant, will be performed every 6 weeks or at any point in which pregnancy is suspected. A standard eye exam will be done on Cycle 3, Day 1. Additional eye exams will be done if you experience any eye-related symptoms, such as changes in vision. Within 1 week after your last dose of the study drug AUY922, you will be asked to return to the clinic for an End of Treatment Visit. At this visit the following will be done: physical examination, performance status, ECG, ECHO or MUGA scan, blood draw, urine test, eye exam, questions about side effects you may have and medications you are taking. You will be asked to return to the clinic about 3 weeks after the End of Treatment Visit (about 4 weeks after the last dose of AUY922) so we can follow-up on any side effects you may still be experiencing after stopping AUY922. If you decide to stop study treatment for a reason other than progression of your disease, you will be asked to have follow-up CT scans or MRIs every 12 weeks to continue to monitor the status of your cancer. If your tumors get worse, you will not need to have any further CT scans (or MRIs) as part of the study. If your disease does progress, we would like to contact you by telephone about every 3 months to check on your status. This will be done until after the last participant stops study treatment, or for as long as you allow us to contact you. Keeping in touch with you and checking on your condition helps us look at the long term effects of the research. You can continue to receive AUY922 for as long as your cancer does not progress and you do not experience unacceptable side effects.',\n",

       "  \"Antipsychotic medications frequently cause metabolic side-effects, such as abdominal obesity, high blood pressure, cholesterol abnormalities, and blood sugar dysregulation, all of which can lead to what is known as the Metabolic Syndrome and serious long-term cardiovascular health problems. Therefore, it is important that metabolic issues be addressed as part of a holistic approach to the mental health treatment of these patients. As with the general population, improving metabolic health involves lifestyle changes - i.e., addressing daily habits regarding eating, physical exercise, stress and sleep management, and lifestyle habits such as smoking. However, there is growing recognition in the medical field that education is not enough for people to create meaningful and sustained lifestyle change. The emerging field of Integrative Health Coaching addresses this issue and provides a clinical framework for helping people successfully develop and achieve personalized lifestyle goals. The investigators have therefore decided to investigate whether health coaching techniques may have benefit in addressing metabolic health issues in people with psychosis disorders. The intent is to complement usual psychiatric and medical care, and also promote patient engagement in managing one's overall health. This study will investigate whether Integrative Health Coaching is a useful clinical tool to facilitate healthy lifestyle behaviour and thereby improve metabolic health in people with psychosis disorders.\",\n",
       "  'Antipsychotic drugs are widely used to treat not only psychosis but an increasing number of other psychiatric indications. The prevalence of antipsychotic drug use in British Columbia is increasing at a high rate, especially in youth. Second generation (\"atypical\") antipsychotic drugs, while bereft of the neurological side-effects of their predecessors, commonly cause metabolic syndrome. This includes hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance, weight gain and hypertension - a cluster of side-effects that puts patients at strongly increased risk of cardiometabolic disorders such as Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Drug therapies to reduce metabolic dysregulation have provided limited benefits. It is recognized that lifestyle changes that address daily habits regarding eating, physical exercise, stress and sleep management, and lifestyle habits such as smoking, represent a complementary approach to additional drug therapy. The emerging field of Integrative Health Coaching addresses this issue and provides a clinical framework for helping people successfully develop and achieve personalized lifestyle goals. This study will investigate whether Health Coaching is a useful clinical tool to facilitate healthy lifestyle behavior and thereby improve metabolic health in people with psychotic illness. HYPOTHESIS: In a first-episode psychosis population that have recently begun treatment with atypical antipsychotic drugs, the inclusion of an Integrative Health Coaching goal-setting model will significantly improve patients\\' attitudes towards, and increase the frequency of behaviours related to healthy living, as indicated by the Short-Form 36, the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire, and the Health Value Scale. RESEARCH PLAN: The investigators will conduct a non-blinded clinical trial of the efficacy of Integrative Health Coaching techniques in 40 subjects who are being treated at the Vancouver/Richmond Early Psychosis Intervention program, which provides specialty care to patients with suspected or newly diagnosed psychotic disorders. All subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups (n = 20 subjects per group). In the first group, subjects will receive treatment for psychosis based on the current standard of care, which includes psychosocial training, education and pharmacological treatment. The second group of subjects will receive not only the standard of care treatment for psychosis, but additional Health Coaching to improve physical health. Subjects in both treatment groups will be given questionnaires to assess health attitudes and behaviours, and will receive routine blood work to monitor metabolic dysregulation, at baseline and months 1, 2, 3 and 6 from when they enter the study. Data will be collected and analyzed for differences between the two groups at the end of the study. Results will be analyzed based on intent-to-treat analysis, and comparison of metabolic and other health indices compared between the two groups using t-test and chi-square analyses.',\n",

       "  \"Mucopolysaccharidosis IV, also known as MPS IV or Morquio disease, is a rare autosomal recessive genetic lysosomal storage disorder. Research thus far regarding lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) in general, including Morquio, has primarily focused on exploring the causes of and finding a treatment for the physical aspects of the various diseases. Less attention has been paid to the psychological or emotional toll of these diseases, whether they are direct symptoms of the diseases themselves or reactions to living with a chronic progressive disease. It is well established in the health psychology literature, however, that the interaction between our physical health and our psychological health is bidirectional; that is, just as our physical health affects us emotionally (e.g. chronic pain can contribute to depression), so can our psychological health affect us physically (e.g. anxiety can contribute to feelings of chest pain). It is thus critically important to pay attention to the emotional and psychological symptoms associated with all lysosomal storage diseases, including Morquio, and expand our treatment standard of care to include mental health treatment, if necessary. The first step in understanding and treating psychological conditions in Morquio disease is determining the natural occurrence of psychological symptoms in this population in comparison with non-medical populations. As little has been done in this regard, a pilot study documenting the occurrence rate of psychological issues and overall quality of life in patients with Morquio is the first item in order and will be the focus of this study. Approximately 20 patients with Morquio disease will be invited to participate, recruited through Emory's Lysosomal Storage Disease Center, as well as through attendance at Morquio support groups and relevant regional, national and/or international meetings. Once consented, patients will be asked to complete three different self-report questionnaires, including the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment (ASEBA) Adult Self-Report (ASR) or Older Adult Self-Report (OASR) questionnaire, the Short Form 36-item Health Questionnaire (SF-36), and the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI).

Oral Iron Replacement Therapy Participants in the low ferritin group will be offered 200 tablets of Ferrous gluconate 325 mg (36 mg elemental iron) sent by mail. Tablets will be in child proof containers. This amount and form of iron were chosen because of its ready accessibility over the counter in packs of 100 at low cost to donor/donor center.

       "  \"Cancer is a leading cause of death in individuals living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) remains the commonest HIV-associated cancer. KS is caused when individuals become infected with both HIV and another virus, Human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8). Laboratory studies have shown that HHV-8 can stimulate biological pathways within KS lesions which promotes their growth. Selumetinib targets these pathways and may therefore be a useful new therapy for KS. Phase I of this trial aims to identify the best dose for the use of selumetinib and investigate the effects of selumetinib treatment on the anti-viral treatment HIV patients receive to control HIV infection. Phase II of this trial will investigate how well selumetinib works as a treatment for KS at the best dose determined in phase I.\",\n",
       "  \"BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE HIV AND KS The prevalence of HIV in the United Kingdom (UK) is rising with about 83,000 living with HIV and 7,000 new cases per annum (pa). At diagnosis a third of patients have severe immune-suppression with a cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) positive cell count less than 200/mm3 (HPA, 2009), which is associated with opportunistic infections and an increase in various tumours. Cancer is a leading cause of death in individuals living with HIV, and KS remains the commonest AIDS-associated malignancy. In a UK prospective cohort followed in the Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART) era, 5.5% of HIV positive patients developed KS (Stebbing et al., 2006). KS is associated with co-infection with HIV and human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8). Patients typically present with multi-focal cutaneous disease often with associated lymphoedema. Extra-cutaneous disease commonly involves the gastrointestinal tract, lung, liver and spleen. For early KS, initiation of HAART may be sufficient to control the disease and radiotherapy is of benefit for localised disease (Di Lorenzo et al., 2007). Currently the only alternative for progressive localised disease is cytotoxic chemotherapy. Cytotoxic chemotherapy with liposomal anthracycline or taxanes, is indicated in patients with widespread cutaneous KS, extensive oral disease or symptomatic visceral involvement (Bower et al., 2008). Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) 20mg/m2 q 3 weeks as first-line therapy in combination with HAART is reported to give tumour response in 55% of patients and median progression free survival (PFS) of 22 weeks (Cooley et al., 2007). Second-line therapy with low dose paclitaxel (100mg/m2 q 2 weeks) is reported to give a response rate of 56% with median PFS of 39 weeks (Tulpule et al., 2002). However the majority of patients' progress despite chemotherapy and new treatment alternatives are required. JUSTIFICATION FOR DESIGN Selumetinib has been tested in a number of phase I and phase II trials as both monotherapy and combined with cytotoxic chemotherapy in patients with advanced solid malignancies. A toxicity profile and recommended dose has been established in these patients. Selumetinib has not been tested in combination with HAART. No significant interactions are predicted between Selumetinib and HAART however a phase I study is required to investigate the pharmacokinetic effects of combining these drugs. In particular we wish to establish that Selumetinib will not reduce the efficacy of HAART. This trial is an open-label multi-centre phase I/II study to investigate the use of selumetinib as a potential treatment for HIV-associated KS. Phase I is an accelerated dose finding study with dosing commencing at 1 dose level below that recommended for monotherapy or in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy. The aims of phase I are to identify a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for selumetinib in patients on HAART whilst proving selumetinib does not reduce the efficacy of HAART. Phase II aims to provide evidence of the efficacy of selumetinib as a treatment for KS. Evidence of efficacy will be assessed via objective response rate to treatment and will be used to develop a protocol for a future randomised phase II/III study.\",\n",

       "  'The management of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) during pregnancy is a matter of continued debate. The introduction of the TKIs in clinical practice has dramatically changed the prognosis of CML. Patients diagnosed in chronic phase can reasonably expect many years of excellent disease control and good quality of life. Thus, the need to address issues related to fertility and pregnancy have arisen. Physicians are frequently being asked for advice regarding the need for, and or the appropriateness of, stopping treatment in order to conceive. The management of fertility begins at diagnosis. This means that immediate and future treatments should be considered at the very beginning. Therefore, the maintenance of fertility should be taken into account since diagnosis. Imatinib is not genotoxic but might lead to a decrease in sperm counts. Nevertheless, Imatinib is teratogenic in rats when given during organogenesis at doses higher than 100 mg/kg, approximately equivalent to 800 mg/day in men. Until now, approximately 60 pregnancies were reported in partners of men on Imatinib. No suggestions of any problems in conception, pregnancy, delivery or any increase in congenital abnormalities were reported. Regarding women, 204 patients were exposed to Imatinib, and 180 were reported in literature (76, 77). Of 180 women exposed to imatinib during pregnancy, outcome data are available for 125 (69%). Of those with known outcomes, 50% delivered normal infants and 28% underwent elective terminations, 3 following the identification of abnormalities. There were a total of 12 infants in whom abnormalities were identified, 3 of which had strikingly similar complex malformations that are clearly a cause for concern. It appears that although most pregnancies exposed to imatinib are likely to have a successful outcome, there remains a risk that exposure may result in serious fetal malformations. Although numbers are small there has been a disturbing cluster of rare congenital malformations such that imatinib cannot be safely recommended, particularly during the period of organogenesis. Last but not least, it has recently been reported a poor outcome after reintroduction of Imatinib in patients who interrupt therapy for pregnancy without having achieved an optimal response (78), introducing another variable in the management of women pregnant while receiving Imatinib. Only few data are available about the use of second generation TKIs, Nilotinib and Dasatinib, during pregnancy. Dasatinib is not mutagenic in rats (in vitro and in vivo tests), but is clastogenic in CHO cells. It does not seem to have such effect on fertility of male and female rats. However, it gives skeletal alterations in rats and rabbits and has embryolethality in rats if administered during pregnancies. Eleven pregnancies were reported while in dasatinib: 5 patients delivered normal infants, while 3 elective termination and 2 spontaneous abortion were reported. On the other hand, 9 male patient conceived during dasatinib: 8 normal infants were delivered, and 1 case was ongoing at the time of the report. Nilotinib is not mutagenic in rats. It does not have any effect on fertility in male and female rats. When administered during pregnancy, there is no evidence of teratogenicity but it is embryo and foetotoxic in the rat and in the rabbit. Only sporadic cases of patients who had been pregnant/had conceived during Nilotinib have been reported, and no speculation should be made from these data. In summary, there are virtually no data regarding II generation TKIs, that must be discontinued by women wishing to become pregnant. Several questions still remains unanswered regarding the management of patients receiving TKIs who want to conceive, or who have been exposed to TKI during pregnancy/conception.',\n",

There is no standard treatment recommendation for this group of patients who failed to second-line therapy and had good performance status. Some cytotoxic drugs for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, i.e. vinorelbine, paclitaxel, and ifosfamide, were used in refractory or recurrent SCLC patients. Recently, a retrospective study showed the overall response rate was 30%, the median progression free survival (PFS) was 6.5 months, and the median overall survival was 10.4 months in advanced combined SCLC patients treated with first-line regimen of vinorelbine, ifosfamide and cisplatin (NIP).

       "  'Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive disease characterized by its rapid doubling time, high growth fraction, early development of disseminated disease, and dramatic response to first-line chemotherapy and radiation. Small cell lung cancer accounts for approximately 20%-25% lung cancer patients. SCLC patients are categorized as limited disease, defined as disease that is confined to the ipsilateral hemithorax that can be encompassed within a tolerable radiation port, or extensive disease (ED), defined as the presence of overt metastatic disease determined by imaging or physical examination. Two third of patients are diagnosed with ED at presentation. Despite the development of novel cytotoxic drugs, the therapeutic approach to SCLC has been stagnant for more than twenty years. Standard treatment for ED-SCLC remains EP or CE, a regimen that yield a median survival of approximately 9 months and a 5-year survival of less than 1%. Most patients are destined to relapse, and the prognosis for this group of patients who relapse is poor. Patients who relapse < 3 months after first-line therapy are commonly called refractory, and patients who relapse 3 months after therapy are labeled as sensitive. In a randomized multicenter study, von Pawel et al compared cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, and vincristine (CAV) with topotecan as a single agent in patients who had relapse at least 60 days (2 months) after initial therapy. The response rates were 24.3% in patients treated with topotecan and 18.3% in patients treated with CAV (P=0.285). Median times to progression were 13.3 weeks for the topotecan arm and 12.3 weeks for the CAV arm. Median survival times were 25 weeks for topotecan and 24.7 weeks for CAV. The proportion of patients with symptom improvement was greater in the topotecan arm than in the CAV arm. The authors concluded that topotecan was at least as effective as CAV in the treatment of patients with recurrent SCLC. So in some guidelines for SCLC, topotecan is recommended as the standard second-line treatment in patients who relapse less than 3 months. As for patients who relapse more than six months after the end of initial treatment, EP or CE regimen is recommended to be used again.',\n",

       "  'Combined Oxytocin and CBSST for Social Function in People With Schizophrenia',\n",
       "  'A significant proportion of people with schizophrenia are characterized by impaired ability to socially engage with others, which may reflect social aversion secondary to defeatist beliefs; decreased motivation for social interactions; and/or impairment in the normal reinforcement value of social interactions. These impairments in social function have been shown to be associated with social skill deficits; and decreased ability to identify and remember emotional facial expressions and empathize with the emotional status of others. Unfortunately, pharmacological interventions have limited benefits for impaired social function, whereas psychosocial interventions provide only partial benefit for this critical aspect of the illness. The development of an effective intervention for functional outcomes remains a central therapeutic challenge. Cognitive Behavioral Social Skills Training (CBSST) uses corrective feedback and reinforcement provided by successful interactions to challenge and reduce defeatist performance beliefs that contribute to low drive and interfere with social functioning. CBSST has been shown to have modest effects on social function in people with schizophrenia. Oxytocin plays a critical role in the regulation of normal social affiliative behavior; it is hypothesized to enhance social affiliation through the reduction of anxiety or social risk aversion; the enhancement of motivation for prosocial approach behavior; and/or increased modulation of the salience and processing of social cues. People with schizophrenia have decreased oxytocin levels, which are associated with an impaired ability to identify facial emotions and decreased prosocial behaviors. The study will be comprised of three phases: 1) 2-week Evaluation Phase; 2) 24-week Double-blind Treatment Phase; and 3) 3-month Follow-up Phase.',\n",
       "  'A NIMH mission priority is the development of new and better interventions, whose focus extends beyond symptom amelioration to the development of interventions that allow people who suffer from severe mental illnesses \"to live full and productive lives\" (NIMH Strategic Plan, 2008). In particular, the NIMH Strategic Plan notes the importance of translating \"research on the biological causes of disorder to inform and develop psychosocial and biomedical interventions that target core features of disease, assess outcomes appropriate to the course of illness under study, and develop study designs that have impact on these features.\" The current proposal is built upon the observations that: 1) people with schizophrenia are characterized by marked impairments in their social function; 2) current pharmacological treatments do not address these impairments; 3) CBSST has been shown to have modest effects on social function in people with schizophrenia. This limited efficacy may be related to the lack of interest or drive people with schizophrenia have for social interactions; 4) oxytocin plays a critical role in normal social affiliative behavior through a) the reduction of anxiety or social risk aversion, b) the enhancement of motivation for prosocial approach or affiliative behavior, and/or c) increased modulation of the salience and processing of social cues; and 5) decreased oxytocin is associated with social function impairments in people with schizophrenia. The proposed study is based on the proposition that the use of a pharmacological agent, whose behavioral effects compliment the psychological mechanisms of action of a psychosocial intervention, is an important adaptation of an intervention previously shown to have moderate effects on social function. The addition of oxytocin to CBSST is hypothesized to: 1) enhance the reduction of defeatist performance beliefs by reducing social risk aversiveness and avoidance, which would increase exposure to reinforcement and corrective feedback; 2) enhance social skill acquisition through improvement of proximal social behaviors, e.g. making eye contact and attending to the facial expressions of social partners; and 3) facilitate the translation of learned social skills into community practice through its effects on prosocial attachment behaviors, reduction in social disinterest, and effects on distal behaviors, e.g. initiating conversations and responding to social invitations. Increased social risk taking within and between sessions would expose participants to a greater frequency of positive feedback and success experiences, which would provide evidence to dispute their defeatist beliefs and social disinterest attitudes. In addition, increased social risk taking could improve homework adherence (e.g., practicing talking to people in the community) and engagement in new community activities. These interactive effects would subsequently lead to a substantial improvement in CBSST efficacy for social function. Ultimately, the importance of improved social function is the effect that such improvement would have on overall levels of health and functioning, including vocational outcome. The proposed study will enable us to collect preliminary data on the acceptability, efficacy, feasibility, and safety of the proposed intervention. In particular, this would be the first study to examine the safety of long-term oxytocin in this population. The study will also provide critical data on the feasibility of recruiting and retaining participants with schizophrenia in a long-term intervention, which combines two different therapeutic modalities: CBSST and oxytocin. If found to be efficacious, feasible, and well-tolerated, we will plan to conduct a larger study, which would include the use of cognitive and imaging biomarkers, to more fully elucidate the mechanism of action of the observed treatment effects. The investigators will address the following specific aims: Aim #1 (Efficacy): To determine if CBSST + oxytocin compared to CBSST + placebo-oxytocin is associated with improved social function. Aim #2 (Safety): To determine if CBSST + oxytocin compared to CBSST + placebo-oxytocin is associated with increased incidence of side effects. Aim #3 (Change Mechanism): To determine if CBSST + oxytocin compared to CBSST + placebo-oxytocin is associated with reduced social aversion, including social disinterest and defeatist performance beliefs; increased ability to trust others; and/or improved performance on facial recognition and memory measures. Aim #4 (Other Outcomes): To determine if CBSST + oxytocin compared to CBSST + placebo-oxytocin is associated with improved neuropsychological test performance, and/or decreased positive, negative, and/or anxiety/depression symptoms, and clinical global improvement.',\n",

       "  'Kinesio taping is a novel method which recently has emerged as a viable option to treat of various musculoskeletal and neuromuscular deficits. The application of tape to injured soft tissues and joints provides support and protection for these structures. Many different techniques are used for injury prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, proprioception and sport. Elastic adhesive tape may be used to unload Myofacial Trigger Points (MTrPs), A trigger point can be located in fascia, ligaments, muscles, and tendons; however, MTrPs are also found in skeletal muscles and/or their fascia. An MTrP is a hyperirritable spot, associated with a taut band of a skeletal muscle that is painful on compression or stretch, and that can give rise to a typical referred pain pattern as well as autonomic phenomena. The use of tape along muscle to unload affected soft tissue seems to be effective in the treatment of trigger points by inhibiting overactive muscle, changing the orientation of fascia and a proprioceptive effect. The purpose of study was to determine the efficacy of Kinesio taping application on trigger point of piriformis muscle.',\n",
       "  'Piriformis syndrome is a peripheral neuritis of the sciatic nerve caused by an abnormal condition of the piriformis muscle. Some investigators consider it as a form of Myofacial pain syndrome which defined as the presence of exquisite tenderness at a nodule in a palpable taut band of muscle. Trigger points are able to produce referred pain, either spontaneously or on digital compression. Although myofascial trigger points are a widely recognized phenomenon in clinical practice, there remains much to be elucidated with regards to their pathophysiology. Conservative pharmacotherapy with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), muscle relaxants, and physical therapy modalities such as heat therapy, cold therapy, ultrasound, electrical current and stretching were traditionally used in the treatment of trigger points. The utilization of Kinesio taping regarding to the proposed mechanisms including 1) restoring correct muscle function by supporting weakened muscles, (2) reducing congestion by improving the flow of blood and lymphatic fluid, (3) decreasing pain by stimulating neurological system, and (4) correcting misaligned joints by retrieving muscle spasm (5) enhancing proprioception through increased stimulation to cutaneous mechanoreceptors can be helpful in restoring muscle function in patients with Myofacial trigger points . However, there are not many controlled studies that have analyzed the effects of the Kinesio taping in their treatment. Therefore, the purpose of study was to determine the efficacy of KT application as an easy and appropriate method on trigger point of piriformis muscle.',\n",

       "  'Background: The connection between gut health and diabetes status is increasingly recognized. Gut microbiota composition in diabetic differs from non-diabetic individuals. Interestingly, the level of glucose tolerance was associated with specific microbiota that was rarely found in healthy individuals. Probiotics is one of the functional foods believed to mediate their health promoting activities through modulating the composition of the gut health. Ingestion of probiotics has been shown not only to influence gut microbiota composition but also the secretion of the gut hormones and insulin resistance in animal models with limited trials in human. Supplementation with probiotic has also been shown not only affect glucose homeostasis, but improved other diabetes related comorbidities such as obesity, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Objectives and hypotheses: To address this research gap, this Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) is proposed to determine the efficacy of probiotic supplementations as adjuvant therapy to improve glucose homeostasis through modulating gut microbiota composition and gut hormones secretion in individuals with type 2 diabetes. We hypothesized that the probiotic supplementations will improve blood glucose control as well as other diabetes related co-morbidities in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Methodology: This is a double blind randomized parallel group control trial with 3 months probiotic supplementation or placebo. After screening the eligible subjects will be selected. Then, after consent taking, subjects will be randomly assigned to either receive probiotic or supplement for 3 months. Measurements of blood parameters including glycemic control related parameters, lipid profile, renal profile, and liver function tests as well as three day diet recall, and anthropometry measurements will take place at baseline, after 6 weeks and after 12 months. Expected Outcomes: Probiotic supplementation as an adjuvant therapy would improve glucose homeostasis and gut health as compared to the placebo and eventually will beneficially affect other diabetes related conditions. This study would provide avenue to identify the possibility of probiotic supplementations as an adjuvant therapy in the management of type 2 diabetes.',\n",

       "  'In the last decade physical exercise has become an accepted and integrated part of rehabilitation in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). However, no studies have evaluated whether the most severely disabled patients can tolerate and benefit from exercise therapy. The purpose of this study is therefore to evaluate the feasibility of endurance training in severely disabled patients with MS.',\n",
       "  'For many years, patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) have been advised not to participate in physical exercise. This advice was given in part because some patients were reported to experience symptom instability during exercise as a consequence of increased body temperature. A further argument was that avoiding exercise would preserve energy and thereby result in less fatigue, leaving more energy for activities of daily living. During the last decade, it has been more common to recommend exercise for MS patients, because of its recently proven beneficial effects in these patients. Resistance- and endurance training constitutes the two extremes of basic physical exercise. To gain insight into the effects of exercise it therefore makes sense to understand the extremes. In mild to moderately impaired MS patients endurance training is well tolerated and providing beneficial effects. However, this exercise modality has not yet been tested in severely disabled patients, and it is therefore unclear if endurance training is feasible and beneficial in these patients. The investigators have, therefore, designed a feasibility study evaluating the effects of 4 weeks of endurance training in severely disabled MS patients (Expanded Disability Status Scale score > 6). Patients are inpatients at one of the national MS hospitals and endurance training is added to the usual care, and compared to usual care only (control group).

Numerous questions and problems are seen with chronic use of oral nitrates. From a practical standpoint, some advocate the withdrawal of medication in stable patients, while many physicians still hesitate to withdraw the medication by the lack of definitive information about its consequences. In this sense there is a rationale for the attempted removal of nitrate fixed these patients, although evidence to support this action have not been adequately evaluated.',\n",

       "  'This research study will test different doses of RG-HRV16 to find the minimum dose needed to give research subjects cold symptoms of at least moderate intensity. The study will also test the safety of RG-HRV16. This information will be used in future studies (for example, to test antiviral preparations, sprays that could protect from getting a cold or decrease cold symptoms or to understand more about how rhinovirus can lead to asthma worsening). RG-HRV16 is a common cold virus that has been made in a new way and has not been used in humans before.',\n",
       "  'Rhinoviruses are the most frequently cause of the common cold. HRV16 (Family Picornaviridae Genus Rhinovirus type 16) has been used extensively to induce colds in studies of experimentally inoculated volunteers that are designed to study the pathogenesis of colds and effects of antiviral medications. Experimental inoculation with human rhinovirus type 16 (HRV16) administered intranasally via aerosolization has been used at the University of Wisconsin for over 30 years, and has proven to be a safe tool to reproducibly induce symptomatic colds. HRV has been linked with exacerbations of asthma and COPD, and this model has been used to evaluate inflammatory mechanisms and to test the efficacy of treatments for the common cold. Recent refinements in the technology available to produce and safety test reagents that are intended to be administered to human volunteers as part of research protocols has prompted us to produce a new lot of HRV16 in accordance with standards of current Good Manufacturing Procedures (cGMP). For this inoculum, we have used a cDNA clone (reverse genetics) to generate source virus, thus this new virus inoculum will be referred to as RG-HRV16. This approach has two main advantages over using viruses isolated from nasal secretions. First, several \"new\" respiratory viruses (e.g. metapneumovirus, bocavirus, SARS, rhinovirus group C) have been discovered in the past 10 years, and there is little doubt that additional viruses will be discovered. Therefore, it is impossible to ensure that nasal secretions that are chosen for isolation of \"seed virus\" contain only the pathogen of interest. This problem is minimized through the use of virus derived from a cDNA clone that was produced in E. coli. Second, RNA viruses, such as HRV, mutate as the virus grows because their RNA polymerases have no error-correcting function. The cDNA clone, reproduced by the much more accurate E. coli DNA polymerase, provides a stable source of virus sequence for production of future inocula. This study represents a first-in-human, phase 1 study to assess the safety of RG-HRV16 in humans and identify the dose needed to produce moderate-to-severe colds in 75% of HRV16-seronegative human volunteers.',\n",

Our primary hypothesis is that genetic variations may underlie individual variability in disease susceptibility, clinical phenotypes and treatment safety, tolerability, and effectiveness.',\n",

In rare instances, if a participant is unable to cooperate with a blood draw, a saliva sample will be collected instead of drawing blood. All eligible participants will be diagnosed with bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder, or be a parent of a child diagnosed with bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder, and will be seen for the study visit at the Department of Psychiatry at University Hospitals of Cleveland, 10524 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH, 44106. Required lab specimens will be collected at University Hospitals Laboratory Services or the Department of Psychiatry, and analyzed at UHCMC and Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) or at an NIH sponsored sequencing or genotyping laboratory. DNA sample from eligible subjects will undergo whole genome genetic analysis using array-based genotyping or sequencing technologies. The clinical phenotypes, treatment response profiles and genotype data will be analyzed using single and multivariate analyses in order to identify genes and genomic regions contributing to inter-patient variability in disease susceptibility, clinical phenotypes and treatment responses. Alternatively, as sequencing costs decline continuously, the DNA samples may undergo targeted genomic region deep sequencing or whole genome sequencing analysis. Any clinical patient, research participant or parent of a child patient, seven years and older, within the Department of Psychiatry will be targeted for enrollment. Eligible participants will be diagnosed with DSM-IV bipolar disorder (type I, II, or not otherwise specified) or DSM-IV major depressive disorder, as determined by an extensive clinical interview and the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview-Plus (MINI-Plus) if applicable or will be a parent of a child diagnosed with bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder. The primary phenotype definition for the genetic analyses proposed here is DSM-IV diagnosis (BD or MDD), phenotypic variables (comorbidities etc.), and treatment response, defined either continuously (change in symptom measures) or categorically (response/non-response), made on the basis of structured diagnostic instruments. In summary, we expect the following types of phenotypic data (as shown in the attached minimum data set CRF) to be available for majority of participants: - Demographic information including gender, age and ethnicity. - Psychiatric diagnosis and history including age of onset and course of mood disorder etc. - Family history of illness including psychiatric disorders, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. The additional clinical variables (from minimum dataset and clinical trials) may define mood disorder subtypes that are more genetically homogeneous and therefore more likely to reveal the influence of genes. Once a participant has signed the informed consent form, a blood sample of approximately 4 teaspoons of blood, or a saliva sample of approximately half a teaspoon of saliva, will be collected for DNA extraction. The DNA samples will be linked with phenotypic data collected from the study participants. The blood draw or saliva collection and minimum data set questions are the only procedures that participants will need to complete once they decide to participate in the study.

Today's principle of treatment is to break the cycle of inflammation and infection. Nowadays, most clinical trials are anti-infective treatment by antibiotics trying to break this cycle by reducing the bacterial load, which may cause bacterial resistance. There were still some anti-inflammation trials by using inhaled corticosteroids(ICS). Tsang and Martínez-García showed that inhaled corticosteroids reduced IL-1,IL-8 levels and sputum inflammation cells, and improved sputum volume as well as quality of life, though the corticosteroid must be high dose or medium dose combined with long-acting ß2 adrenergic agonists. As described in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease(COPD), theophylline can improve the activity of histone deacetylase (HDAC) and then enhanced the anti-inflammatory effect of steroids.

       "  'Recently, beneficial effects on Meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) of a single automated thermal pulsation with the Lipiflow® system have been reported in several case reports. In one study this treatment was compared with hyperthermia (iheat®) for 4 weeks. However, treatment recommendations for lid hygiene according to the MGD-report consist of hyperthermia followed by lid massage and lid margin cleansing over several months. To the best of the investigators knowledge this is the first randomized prospective study to compare automated thermal pulsation treatment with the new Lipiflow ® system with a standard lid hygiene regime. The investigators suggest that a single treatment with Lipiflow® is superior to a lid hygiene regime.',\n",
       "  \"Once a patient has been identified as a possible candidate for the study, he/she is first informed verbally and in writing about the study. After signing the consent form he/she will be randomized to either the Lipiflow® treatment (Lipiflow® group) or alternatively be given an instruction sheet and a verbal explanation for lid warming and massage (lid hygiene group). After 3 month a cross-over of the lid hygiene group to the Lipiflow® group is conducted. A full examination is performed before and 4 weeks and 3 months after therapy. All tests are performed by a physician or trained graduate students of the Department of Ophthalmology, Heinrich-Heine University. The examiner is blinded, i.e. he does not know which treatment the patient will receive or receiving. Treatment Lipiflow®: The automated thermal pulsation with Lipiflow® provides is a low risk therapy. After local anesthesia the applicators are inserted. These look like a kind of goggles and consist of two parts which embrace the eyelids from the front and from behind. Through the rear part heat is applied to a maximum of 42.5° C. By isolating the heat remains on the eyelid limited. Through the front part the gland a massage is performed. The treatment takes 12 minutes per eye and can be done depending on the patient's wishes simultaneously or one eye after the other. The therapy is approved by the FDA as a medical technical innovation and has also been approved by ISO and CE Mark certification for use in Europe. Irritation or minor trauma of the eyelids and the conjunctiva and cornea, as well as a violation of the eyelids and the conjunctiva and cornea are theoretically possible, but extremely unlikely. Permanent damages to the eyes have not been reported in the literature. In the unlikely event, that complications occur during treatment, requiring an additional treatment, this is performed in the department of ophthalmology of the Heinrich-Heine University Duesseldorf. Test parameters: At any time of investigation, the following parameters are evaluated: Lipiview®, Tear Lab®, Schirmer test, break-up time, corneal and conjunctival fluorescein staining, Meibomian gland evaluation (MGE), examination of the eyelids, Meibography, OSDI score, SPEED score All test parameters are established procedures and have in common a very low risk of harm to the patient. In detail: The Lipiview® is a device that quantifies the thickness of the lipid layer of the tear film using interferometry. For this the patient looks into a kind of camera while recordings of his tear film are made, which are then analyzed by a computer. Tear Lab® is a method for measuring tear film osmolarity. A pen-like instrument (the osmometer) is held on the tear meniscus and collects 100 nl tears within fractions of a second in the unit. There is no need for local anaesthesia. By electrical impedance measurement, then the tear film osmolarity is measured. The examiner can then read the values digitally. The Schirmer test consists of a strip of filter paper that is placed in the conjunctival sac of the patient for five minutes. The filter paper absorbs the tear fluid and the stained by the tear fluid line serves as a measure of tear secretion. Tear break-up time is the time between a blink and the tear film shows signs of breaking up. In this study this is measured non-invasive with the Oculus-Keratograph 5 M®. The patient looks into a kind of camera while recordings of his tear film are made which are then analyzed by a computer. Vital corneal and conjunctival epithelium cannot be stained by fluorescein. The dye adheres to nonviable cells. The degree of staining, can be judged by the investigator by slit-lamp examination. For evaluation of the secreting meibomian glands a specialized device (Meibomian gland evaluator) is used, that provides a defined pressure to the lid. The examiner observes the ducts of the Meibomian glands and assesses how many glands are yielding secretion. Examination of the eyelids is done using a slit lamp to assess a thickening or a significant vascularisation the lid margin. To perform meibography the lids are illuminated by infrared light. Functional acini of the glands become clearly visible and can be differentiated from atrophic acini. The number of atrophic meibomian glands can be counted by a score. OSDI (Ocular-Surface-Disease-Index) and SPEED (Standard Pattern Evaluation of Eye Dryness) are questionnaires to quantify the symptoms of dry eye.\",\n",

The study will also examine patterns of sexual risk behavior among high-risk HIV-1 uninfected YMSM in the U.S. who are provided with open label FTC/TDF (Truvada®) as PrEP. The study will also explore the feasibility and acceptability of implementing two different types of efficacious risk reduction interventions prior to the provision of PrEP - 3MV and PCC. The inclusion of a behavioral intervention in this project not only addresses our ethical responsibility of providing at least the minimum risk reduction education to all subjects given the high HIV risk of our study population, but also builds behavioral skills to assist subjects in reducing their risk when not taking PrEP. Furthermore, the study will evaluate the process of protocol implementation to better understand how to best implement PrEP research and program practice at adolescent medicine sites, including an evaluation of consent procedures and the acceptability/feasibility of allowing youth minors to consent for their own participation in this HIV prevention intervention, to the extent allowable by local laws and regulations, and to allow youth minor participation in a clinical trial without requiring disclosure of their sexual orientation and risk behaviors to their parents or guardians.',\n",

Research studies found a subgroup of children who had Obsessive compulsive (OCD) and/or tic disorders following a Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GAS) infection. The subgroup is identified by the acronym, PANDAS (pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections. More recently, several PANDAS variants have been described, including adult-onset variant. There are many evidences that OCD/tic symptoms could be due to an immunologic reaction against brain tissues following a streptococcal infection. The purpose of this study is to know if sertraline (one of the SSRI approved by FDA to improve OCD/tic symptoms in these patients) plus antibiotic (benzathine penicillin G or azithromycin in case of penicillin allergy) is more effective than SSRI only. Patients who will not respond to antibiotic will be treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in order to inactivate the immune reaction versus brain tissues.(No treatment response is based on the lack of a Y-BOCS score improvement of at least 35%). Objectives: - To determine the safety and efficacy of SSRI+AB compared to SSRI only. - To test the safety and additional beneficial effects of high dose of IVIG on antibiotic prophylaxis for the treatment of OCD symptoms in non-responders patients with PANDAS. Study methodology: - Participants will be screened to obtain medical history and other information at Neurologic and Psychiatric Sciences Department of Florence University Hospital and at Paris-est University. - Participants will receive a treatment of either SSRI+AB or SSRI+placebo for 12 weeks (double-blind randomized trial) - Patients who will not respond to AB will be admitted to the hospital to receive IVIG for 5 days, for 5 consecutive months. - Follow-up visits will take place 3 and 6 months after the first evaluation, followed by 6 months follow-ups for 3 additional years. Blood samples (including blood cytokine determination), ECG, Doppler and 2-dimensional echocardiogram EEG, imaging studies (2 tesla MRI), and other tests will be performed both before and after the treatment with SSRI+AB or SSRI+placebo and in case also after IVIG treatment.',\n",

The ketogenic diet unfortunately, offers no long-term solution to seizure control.

       "  \"Hospital acquired pneumonia (HAP) is a common complication of extended hospital stay. In surgical specialities and critical care early physiotherapy is a recognised way of preventing such infections, and reducing length of hospital stay (LOS), however prevention of this problem is less well studied in medical inpatients. The investigators propose a pilot study to assess the impact of introducing an early mobilisation strategy to general medical and respiratory wards at an acute Trust in the United Kingdom (UK). The investigators will recruit all new admissions to each of 2 respiratory and 2 elderly care wards - 1 of each ward type will be allocated to receive extra physiotherapy input targeting new admissions for early mobilisation. Patients' usual mobility, current mobility and actual activity levels will be studied by accelerometer and simple patient questionnaire in the first 48 hours of admission, and compared between groups. Incidence of HAP and total LOS will be recorded and compared between groups. The investigators hypotheses are that the physiotherapy intervention will increase activity levels, reduce incidence of HAP and reduce LOS. The latter may result in cost savings to the National Health Service (NHS), which the investigators will model using local tariff data. The investigators plan to use our data to power a larger randomised controlled study, or if the intervention is a marked success, such that a control group would be unethical, then a wider service development and evaluation programme.\",\n",

       "  \"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an increasing common disease. It ranges from being asymptomatic to a highly disabling condition with a severe impact on quality of life. It is termed paroxysmal (PAF) when an episode lasts less than 7 days, persistent (PerAF) when it lasts more than 7 days and needs intervention and permanent (PermAF) when it is accepted as the long term rhythm. Treatment is based on symptom control and the prevention of complications such as stroke. When an attempt is made to restore normal sinus rhythm (NSR), this is termed 'rhythm control'. Treatments for rhythm control of AF can be broadly divided into pharmacological and ablative. Ablative techniques1 are typically performed percutaneously using catheter-based technology (minimally invasive), though some surgical techniques also exist. They work on the principle that performing a series of 'burns' (scar) in appropriate places can prevent abnormal electrical signals forming and propagating within the heart. The problem of atrial fibrillation is vast. Prevalence ranges from 0.2% in the 45-54 age group, rising to 8% in the over 75s. Though the majority of patients can be satisfactorily treated medically, in a not insignificant portion, the drugs are either poorly tolerated or are ineffective. For these patients, the United Kingdom (UK) NICE guidelines recommend consideration of an ablation procedure. In Derriford hospital alone we see approximately 14 patients suitable for AF ablation in a typical month. The electrophysiological consequences of ablation are unclear. It is not known whether complete bidirectional electrical block across the ablation lines isolating the pulmonary antral region from the rest of the left atrium is a prerequisite for long-term cure of Atrial Fibrillation (AF). Studies in canine models of atrial fibrillation have suggested that incomplete lines of block can be as effective in reducing AF burden as complete lines, however the limited number of follow up studies in humans that have assessed both patients with recurrent AF and also asymptomatic patients who appear to have been cured by catheter ablation have suggested that complete electrical isolation of the pulmonary veins is necessary for a cure. Advocates for ablation without assessing electrical block argue success rates in humans are similar whether circumferential electrical isolation of the pulmonary veins is achieved or not. Assessing freedom from AF and correlating it with the presence or absence of complete bidirectional electrical block, intra-operatively and at post one-year follow-up, will allow a further understanding of the mechanisms determining the success or failure of AF ablation therapies. This will be very important in knowing how to treat patients in whom AF still occurs and will guide the approach to subsequent interventions. Though there is a small risk involved in this study, the question it addresses will have a significant impact on the development of future AF ablation techniques. Within this group, over 300 separate ablation procedures have been performed with no deaths or significant complications. Previous groups have published trans-septal observational studies in humans demonstrating that previous ethics committees have appreciated the importance of such work. The 2012 Heart Rhythm Society (HRS)/European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA)/European Cardiac Arrhythmia Society (ECAS) consensus statement on catheter and surgical ablation for AF has recently highlighted the need for novel trial designs demonstrating 'durability of pulmonary vein isolation' with a repeat diagnostic electrophysiological study. This trial will therefore increase our understanding of the electrophysiological properties associated with successful ablation and how Atrial Fibrillation ablation and the HIFU procedure work.\",\n",

       "  'In 2008 a new ventilation strategy termed variable Pressure Support ventilation (PSV) was introduced, which is able to increase the variability of the respiratory pattern independent from the inspiratory effort. In experimental lung injury, variable PSV was found to improve gas exchange and decrease the inspiratory effort, while reducing alveolar edema and inflammatory infiltration compared to conventional(non-variable) PSV. Importantly, variable PSV reduced peak airway pressure and respiratory system elastance in a variability dependent manner.In addition, preliminary observations suggest that variable PSV can reduce the work of breathing and improve patient comfort, but it is not known whether this new ventilatory strategy is able to speed the weaning from mechanical ventilation. Since variable PSV can reduce the mean pressure support, it may lead to a faster reduction of pressure support and, therefore, a shorter weaning period than conventional PSV. The hypothesis of this study is that variable pressure support ventilation reduces the duration of mechanical ventilation to non-variable (conventional) pressure support ventilation.',\n",

The condition, referred to as microvascular angina (MVA) or cardiac syndrome X, is not as benign as originally reported—patients presenting with unstable angina and nonobstructive atherosclerotic coronary artery disease have a 2% risk of death or myocardial infarction at 30 days of follow-up. It is more common in women in whom the first presentation of angina occurs either perimenopausally or postmenopausally. Aberrant flow-mediated coronary vasomotion is pivotal in the pathogenesis (systemic) impairment in endothelial function. Indeed, some centers use systemic assessments of vascular function in their diagnostic pathways for this group of women.

       "  'The overall aim of this program of research is to develop a collaborative psychotherapy for major depressive disorder (MDD) specifically for primary care patients with MDD and comorbid chronic low back pain (CLBP). The newly developed intervention will integrate and build on behavior therapy for MDD and behavior therapy for chronic pain towards a key target of reducing behavioral avoidance. This 4-month collaborative psychotherapy, entitled Program for Emotional and Physical Pain (PEPP), will include 1 joint meeting with the behavioral health specialist (BHS), primary care provider (PCP), and patient, 10 psychotherapy sessions, and continued collaboration between the BHS and the PCP to assure a shared treatment plan. The purpose of the proposed project is to establish the feasibility and acceptability of a research design for an eventual large-scale randomized clinical trial which would test the efficacy of PEPP in comparison to a control condition (depression care management).. To achieve the investigators specific aims, the investigators will conduct a pilot randomized clinical trial (n = 30), with two treatment arms; PEPP (which includes procedures used in care management) or care management. The specific aims are: 1. To develop and refine PEPP so that it meets standards of feasibility and acceptability for primary care physicians (PCPs), behavioral health specialists (BHSs), and participants; 1. To develop, field-test, and finalize a PEPP manual; 2. To develop a reliable measure of BHS adherence to the manual; 3. To develop, field-test, and finalize BHS training and supervision procedures; 2. To field-test and finalize procedures for depression care management; 3. To establish that the investigators can adequately provide depression care management and that it is acceptable in this population; 4. To develop and refine recruitment methods for an RCT and document an adequate rate of recruitment; 5. To refine research procedures, e.g., consent process, randomization process, and assessment procedures, and establish their feasibility and acceptability to participants. Ultimately, the investigators expect that this treatment development work will prepare us to apply for an R01 to conduct a large-scale, adequately powered RCT with the same research design as the pilot RCT proposed in this application. Depression will be the primary outcome variable assessed in the large-scale RCT; pain will be a secondary outcome variable. In the end, the investigators believe this line of work will lead to the incorporation into primary care of theoretically-driven and effective mental health treatment for patients with MDD and comorbid CLBP. To the best of the investigators knowledge, this would be the first empirically-tested psychotherapy protocol that specifically integrates treatment of major depression with CLBP.',\n",

       "  'Main lines of the study. Evolution of patient\\'s health after hospital discharge is poorly documented. We hypothesize that information of good quality on this concern might be accessible at a relatively low cost from patients, further referred to as sentinel patients, who would voluntary report their health evolution on a dedicated website. The SENTIPAT study presents as a proof of concept study. It will collect patient\\'s health evolution during a post-hospital discharge period of 45 days. The study presents as a randomized trial comparing patients\\' reports issued from two different methods in patients returning home after hospital discharge and having at disposal an internet connection available at home (further referred to as \"eligible patients\"): in the \" Internet \" arm, sentinel patients will be solicited to directly report their data on a web-site especially devoted for collecting these data while in the \" Telephone \" arm, the same data will be collected through a telephone interview 45 days after hospital discharge. Investigations will concern appearance/worsening of symptoms, healthcare resources utilization, quality of life, and patients\\' satisfaction. Adverse events. An adverse event is defined as non-related to patient\\'s disease but associated with a default or excess of care. A clinically significant event is defined as one of the following events: new symptom(s) appearing after hospital discharge or worsening for symptoms present at hospital discharge, unscheduled rehospitalization or consultation whatever the reason for it, death (patients lost to follow-up will be investigated for their vital status). A validated event is an event considered as adverse by a validation medical committee, blind in terms of the source declaration whatever the source (sentinel patients or telephone survey). In addition, the committee will classify each validated event according to a criterion of avoidability. Design. The main hypothesis of the study is that the risk of clinically significant validated adverse event is at least as well reported by volunteer patients (sentinel patients: Internet arm) as by a specific cohort follow-up (Telephone survey arm). SENTIPAT presents as a multi-center (five departments within the same hospital) non-inferiority randomized trial comparing the internet and telephone arms. Enrollment of eligible patients will be performed on the basis of consecutive such patients being discharged from hospital in the participating departments. Internet/Telephone randomization of eligible patients is stratified per department. In addition, in order to estimate the distance of representativeness of eligible patients, a substantial number of patients having no internet access at their home (further referred to as \"non eligible patients\") will also be recruited and compose a third arm where patients are not randomized: all non eligible patients will be investigated via a telephone interview 45 days after discharge, just as the patients in the Telephone arm. No intermediate analysis was planned. Primary objective. The primary outcome criterion is the proportion of patients reporting at least a \"clinically significant validated\" adverse event (see definition below) occurring during the period of 45 days after hospital discharge. The observed proportions in the Internet and Telephone arms will be compared. Secondary objectives. The secondary objectives include: A) related to the primary criterion: - Nature, chronology, severity and avoidability of the clinically significant adverse events - Proportion of validated adverse events issued from the Internet and Telephone reports - Association between adverse event occurrence and a) patient\\'s perceived quality of care/health (SF-36 questionnaire, perceived health state-visual analogic scale-at admission, discharge, and 45 days after discharge), and b) post-discharge continuity of care (information transmitted to the post-discharge referent physician(s) of the patient). B) related to the proof of concept for sentinel patients: - Proportion of eligible patients, active sentinels, their characteristics as compared to the patient population hospitalized in the departments participating in the study. - Rate for internet equipment and utilization. - Rate of participation and completion of the questionnaires. - Estimate the costs of the sentinel patients\\' information system and compare these costs to those of a specific cohort survey. C) related to the objective of assessing the representativeness distance of eligible patients: - Comparing the whole set of variables at baseline (i.e. inclusion, day of hospital discharge) between non eligible and eligible patients (e.g., socio-demographic characteristics-age, sex, social support-, hospital stay characteristics-reason, length, medication prescribed at discharge-). - Comparing the rate of adverse events avoidable or not between the three arms (Non Eligible, Eligible-Internet, Eligible-Telephone). - Making the above comparison in relation with hospital stay features, post-discharge other features (i.e. excluding post-discharge adverse events). - Measuring patient\\'s satisfaction (SAPHORA-MCO© questionnaire) and quality of life. The observed measures in the three arms will be compared. - Description of the healthcare resources utilized after hospital discharge (consultations including their delay). Sample size. Calculation was based on non-inferiority between two collection sources (Internet vs Telephone) of clinically significant adverse events in eligible patients. According to Forster et al (Ann Intern Med 2003, Cmaj 2004) we retained the target of 20% patients presenting at least such an event, and an equivalence limit of 5%. A 80% power is obtained through the inclusion of 2050 patients, 1025 in the Internet arm, and 1025 in the Telephone arm. In parallel, we planned to enroll 500 non eligible patients. The protocol plans the total enrollment of 2550 patients, with 205, 205, and 100 patients in the Internet, Telephone and Non Eligible arms, respectively, in each of the five participating departments. Statistical methods. The results of the study will be presented according to CONSORT recommendations adapted to non-inferiority trials. Patients of the Internet and Telephone arms will constitute the sample for all comparisons between internet and telephone, which constitute the primary objective of the study. This same population will be considered for the comparative cost study. Eligible vs non eligible patients will constitute the sample for studying the representativeness of eligible patients to be sentinel vs non eligible patients. Primary analysis will be conducted using an \"intention to watch over\" strategy, applying the rule \"lost to follow-up implies absence of event in the corresponding patients\". Such an imputation of missing values is the most appropriate for rejecting the non-inferiority hypothesis in case of an important imbalance in the rate of lost to follow-up between the Internet and the Telephone groups. However, intention to treat is not usual in non-inferiority trials. Therefore sensitivity analyses restricted to patients with follow-up data will also be conducted. Analysis of the primary outcome will be made by determining the bilateral 95% confidence interval of the difference in the proportion of patients with at least a validated clinically significant adverse event between the Internet and the Telephone groups, and by excluding the value of 5% of this interval. Considering secondary analyses, within each of the participating departments, between group comparisons will be made using a Mann-Whitney or a Kruskall-Wallis test for quantitative variables, using Fisher\\'s exact test for categorical variables, and using the Log-Rank test for duration variables. Considering the whole departments, The Friedman test will be used for quantitative variables and the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test will be used for categorical variables. Generalized linear regression models will be used for multivariate analyses of the criteria within the participating departments (multiple linear modeling, logistic regression, survival proportional hazards model) and generalized estimating equations modeling (with exchangeable correlations) will be used on departments\\' pooled data. Analyses will be conducted using SAS and R software. The primary perspective retained for the cost analysis is the hospital perspective. A more complete analysis using a societal perspective might be considered later, including opportunity costs supported by sentinel patients. Most cost values will be directly issued from the study and all those involving horary tasks will be valued according to the human capital approach. The costs of the sentinel surveillance will include the costs associated to the development and the maintenance of the associated information system. The costs of the telephone survey will include those related to call management organization and to operator human time. Time spent for patient selection, inclusion, collection of non-opposition agreement, event coding, validation, and data analysis will be measured in the two groups of patients. Cost data will be balanced with participation rates and with questionnaires\\' completion and quality rates. In the end, costs for the Internet and Telephone strategies will be contrasted with the corresponding detection rates of adverse events. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the Telephone strategy vs a patient\\'s sentinel website will be estimated. Two situations will be considered: either limited to the study, the website being non-perennial, or considering a more intensive use: for example, models will explore wider multi-center uses of the website and longer periods than that that of the study (the latters implying an increase in maintenance costs but also a return of investment for the website development). The cost-effectiveness ratios in the two situations may substantially differ in the two situations.',\n",

       "  'Background: Ascites is a frequent complication of cirrhosis, occurring in 50% of patients and is associated with 50 % mortality in two years. Bacterial infections in patients with cirrhosis are frequent during hospitalization and is an important precipitating event for the development of renal failure and hepatorenal syndrome, hepatic encephalopathy and possibly also variceal bleeding. High Child-Pugh Score, variceal bleeding and low ascitic fluid protein levels are associated with high risk of infection. The infections are mainly triggered by gut bacterial translocation, the migration of microorganisms from the intestinal lumen to mesenteric lymph nodes or extra-intestinal sites. Some studies have shown derangements in the gut micro ecology of patients with liver cirrhosis, partly due to a decrease in small intestinal motility, which could cause small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Combined with structural and functional alterations of the intestinal mucosa and deficiencies in defense mechanisms, this bacterial overgrowth contributes to bacterial translocation. Circulating bacterial DNA is a marker of bacterial translocation that may enhance endothelial dysfunction and predict a poor outcome in cirrhosis and ascites. Selective gut decontamination prevents spontaneous bacterial infections and improves survival in advanced cirrhosis, such as in variceal bleeding and in patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Patients with advanced cirrhosis are, apart from having portal hypertension, characterized by a marked systemic vasodilatation, an increased cardiac output and a low central blood volume. This could be due to raised levels of endotoxins in the blood and the induced inflammatory response. This induces increased expression and activation of nitrogen oxidase synthase leading to excessive NO production and further vasodilatation. Moreover, high levels of cytokines (LPS-BP, Interleukin-6 and TNF-a), is associated with a lower systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and a higher cardiac output (CO) in cirrhotic patients. In decompensated cirrhosis several vasoactive hormones are activated to counterbalance this vasodilatation. In animal studies, it has been shown that oral antibiotics might reduce bacterial translocation and the vasodilatation in the splanchnic vasculature. Rifaximin seems to be an attractive alternative that exerts a broad-range of antimicrobial activity including gram-positive bacteria. Rifaximin induces less bacterial resistance and acts predominantly in the small intestine, the site of bacterial overgrowth in cirrhosis. Rifaximin has been shown to reduce the risk of hepatic encephalopathy, with less side effects than traditional lactulose treatment. The hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) is a marker of severity of cirrhosis and has important prognostic value in the assessment of risk of complications to cirrhosis. An uncontrolled study has suggested that rifaximin may decrease HVPG(8). A recently published pilot study has furthermore suggested, that rifaximin might improve systemic haemodynamics by decreasing cardiac output and also increasing glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Aim: This novel, investigational trial will be assessing the effect of rifaximin on pathophysiology and haemodynamics in the patient with liver cirrhosis, and addressing the effect of rifaximin on several organs on marker level. We will explore the molecular and physiological effects of rifaximin rather than confirming evidence of its already known beneficial effects. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that intestinal decontamination with rifaximin in patients with cirrhosis and ascites will interrupt bacterial translocation, diminish the following inflammatory response, prevent splanchnic vasodilatation and portal systemic contraction and thereby reduce the risk of clinical complications to cirrhosis. Hence, rifaximin: 1. Will decrease portal pressure, measured as the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG). 2. Will ameliorate the peripheral and splanchnic vasodilatation by a decrease in cardiac output (CO) and an increase in arterial blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance (SVR). These effects should also be reflected by a trend towards normalization of vasoactive hormones. 3. Will improve renal function expressed as an increase in glomerular filtration rate. 4. Will down regulate markers of inflammation expressed as a decrease in proinflammatory cytokines (i.e. TNF-a and interleukins) and high sensitivity CRP. 5. Attenuate markers of infection, expressed by bacterial DNA and lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LPS-BP). 6. Inhibit small intestinal bacterial overgrowth as measured by breath tests and intestinal transit-time in a subgroup of patients. Methods: Trial design: This is a randomized, placebo controlled clinical trial. We aim to randomize in the relation 2:1, including 38 patients for rifaximin treatment and 19 patients for placebo. These numbers are based on power calculations demanding a power of 80% probability of a true finding. Trial participants: Our trial population will consist of adult, legally competent patients with liver cirrhosis Child-Pugh score B or C and ascites. Patients that fulfill inclusion criteria will be recruited from hospitals in the capital region of Denmark. The patients will be referred to Hvidovre hospital for liver vein catheterisation, a diagnostic procedure included in the standard diagnostic programme for liver cirrhosis. Initiation of trial: The patient is admitted to hospital and baseline investigations are performed, including clinical examination, blood samples, glucose breath test, blood and urine culture, ascites puncture, faecal samples, and examination of continuous reaction time. On the second day of admission liver vein catheterization and assessment of renal function is performed and samples of blood from femoral artery and hepatic vein is drawn. Then the patient is randomized to tablet rifaximin treatment or placebo for 28 days. During the period of treatment the patient is closely monitored by an outpatient visit and by contact on telephone. End of trial: At the end of the trial period, patients are re-hospitalized and the investigational programme is repeated. After six months a register follow up Time schedule: November 2012: Initiation of trial and enrollment of first patients. November 2014: Enrollment of the last patients and investigations. May 2015: End of follow up and trial lock. Spring 2015: Assessments and analysis of first data. Summer/Autumn 2015: Publication of results. Collaborating units: Department of Gastroenterology, Department of Clinical Physiology and Nuclear medicine, Unit of Radiology and Diagnostic Research and Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Clinical Research Centre, all Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre. Rifaximin tablets and placebo tablets are delivered by Norgine Denmark A/S, free of costs, and labelled and packed by Region Hovedstadens Apotek. The Good Clinical Practice Unit, Capital Region of Denmark, monitors the trial. Patients are screened for inclusion at Departments of gastroenterology, and internal medicine at hospitals within the Capital Region of Denmark Implications of the trial: If rifaximin can correct small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and demonstrate improvement in liver haemodynamics, renal function and systemic dynamics, then these effects may contribute to the overall well-being of the patient and prevent complications to the underlying cirrhosis such as risk of infections, progression of disease, and admission to hospital. It is possible that trial participants randomized to rifaximin treatment will experience an improvement in both kidney function and bowel function, with less distress, flatulence or diarrhea. It is also possible that this group of patients will have fewer complications to their cirrhosis, such as fewer admissions to hospital, fewer infections and a smaller risk of variceal bleeding and SBP. It is also a possibility, but not certain, that participants randomized to rifaximin will experience improvement in their mental status and their general condition, for example less fatigue, better appetite and more strength. Participation in this trial contributes to new knowledge about the foundations and scientific background that causes the serious complications to liver cirrhosis, thus enabling us to improve diagnosis and treatment of this disease and its comorbidity. This is a pathophysiological and investigational trial, and besides the mentioned benefits for the participant, he or she will also contribute to the possible development of new treatment regimens for liver cirrhosis. If intestinal decontamination with rifaximin alleviates the mechanism leading to decompensation and its complications it may potentially have a clinical impact in advanced cirrosis beyond preventing recurrent hepatic encephalopathy. The aspects are prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in patients at risk of this disease, and potentially prophylaxis for patients with biochemical signs of bacterial translocation.',\n",

       "  \"Accurately predicting the risk factors of patients' suffering a drug overdose plays a crucial role in effective prevention of drug overdose. In order to investigate possible risk factors for drug overdose, the NHS Fife Research & Development Office funded this project to be carried out by a group of researchers based in the University of St Andrews, in collaboration with the NHS Fife Addiction Services. To improve our understanding of drug misusers' risk of suffering a drug overdose, the investigators focus on the factors that are associated with the aspects of the addiction consultation process (e.g. verbal and non-verbal behaviours of clinicians and patients). The investigators are particularly interested in how clinicians recognize and manage patients' emotional concerns during consultations. Based on the empirical evidence in the area of patient-centred consultation, the investigators hypothesize that successful management of patient emotional distress is positively correlated with improved healthcare outcomes including patient's feeling more emotionally valued and satisfied with the consultation. The investigators also hypothesize, according to the research findings on the relationship between facial expressions and suicidal reattempt, that some non-verbal behaviours during consultation (e.g. patient's 'looking down' activity) are related to patient's risk of suffering a drug overdose. After obtaining informed consent from clinicians and patients, the investigators will video record a patient's first consultation session with a key worker within the NHS Fife Addition Services. The investigators expect to collect a minimum of 16 consultations (about eight clinicians with two patients per staff member) for this one-year pilot study. A validated coding scheme will be modified to code patients' expressions of emotional distress and clinicians' responses. Additional survey method will be also employed to collect demographic information and patient satisfaction. The investigators hope the findings of the study will improve our understanding of drug overdose risk factors and contribute to the development of drug overdose prevention programmes.\",\n",
       "  \"Background Drug misusers present to addiction services a wide range of problems with the most serious consequence of drug overdose being the threat to life. Accurately predicting the risk of suffering a drug overdose therefore plays a crucial role in effective prevention of drug overdose. So far, most effect have been focused on investigating predictive variables that are related to drug misusers' subjective perceptions of coping abilities and measures of life experience or treatment history. However, very little attention has been directed to the factors that are associated with the aspects of the addiction consultation process, where clinicians have a greater degree of control over patient interaction. Some initial empirical evidences suggest that clinicians' and patients' facial expressions were predictive of suicidal reattempt. It was found that doctors showed a higher frequency and intensity in frowning working with suicide repeaters than with non-repeaters. In addition, repeater patients were found to have a higher activity of the mouth and to look downwards significantly more often. This line of study has laid some foundation for a new way of prediction through observation of clinician-patient interactions. We are therefore interested in exploring some non-verbal behaviours of both clinicians and patients during the consultation process that are potentially predictive of a patient's risk of suffering a drug overdose. Regarding how verbal communicative behaviours during the consultation process might influence patient care outcomes, findings from other healthcare communication areas have consistently demonstrated that patient-centred communication is positively correlated with improved patient health outcomes. One key feature of a patient-centred consulting style is clinicians' ability to verbally recognize and address individual patients' emotional distress. To our knowledge, it is the first time to investigate how clinicians manage patients' emotional distress affects patient care outcomes in a drug service setting. No validated coding schemes so far have been developed to explore the relationship between aspects of interaction and drug service outcomes. In other areas of healthcare communication, the Verona Coding Definitions of Emotional Sequences (VR-CoDES) has been frequently used to code patient expressions of emotional distress and provider responses. Although it has been widely used in a variety of contexts from psychiatric contexts to dental settings, it has not yet been used in consultations involving drug users. We are therefore interested to test the applicability of the system in a drug service setting after a suitable modification. Drug addiction consultation is usually an emotion-provoking environment and accurate perception of patient emotions has become a precondition for empathic responses. The modification of a validated coding scheme to be suitable for the drug service context will be the first useful tool to help clinicians to recognize patients' emotional concerns and thereby improving the quality of patient care. With the modified version of the VR-CoDES as an analysis tool, we aim to identify factors that are associated with aspects of the consultation process, particularly the verbal and non-verbal behaviours of both clinicians and patients, to improve our understanding of drug misusers' risk of suffering a drug overdose. The main research questions are summarized below. Research questions - What communicative behaviours observed in the interaction between clinicians and drug user patients are predictive of patent's risk of suffering a drug overdose? In other words, we are interested in exploring what verbal and non-verbal behaviours of both clinicians and patients during the consultation process predict a patient's risk of suffering a drug overdose. - We are also interested in exploring how clinicians respond to patients' expressions of emotional distress during the consultation process and how successful management of emotional worries might be related to improved patient satisfaction. Furthermore, we are keen to investigate whether the Verona Coding Definitions of Emotional Sequence (VR-CoDES) can be reliably applied to the drug consultation context after suitably modified. In other words, whether patients' expressions of emotional cues and concerns and clinicians' responses to them can be identified and reliably coded using the modified VR-CoDES. Research design It will be a one year, pilot observational study with video recording of clinician-patient consultation within a single site of NHS Fife Addiction Services, based in the Whyteman's Brae Hospital in Kirkcaldy. In the future, more sites may be considered to achieve a larger sample size when this pilot study is complete on NHS Fife single site, largely due to the time constraint. The Overdose Risk Assessment Questionnaire (ORA) and the Treatment Outcomes Profile Questionnaire (TOP) are two questionnaires that have already been routinely used by the Addiction Nurses within the NHS Fife Addition Services. We hope to exert a minimum extra workload to the staff participants and will respect their normal implementation procedure of the questionnaires. Two pieces of information obtained from the ORA questionnaire will be included in the analysis. First, the overall risk assessment score on the first assessment with a key worker before the video observation will be used to compare with the behavioural factors emerged from the interactions for predicting patient drug overdose risk. For example, high risk assessment scores might be correlated with a high frequency of patient 'looking down' non-verbal behaviour. Second, some relevant information, such as depression and emotional abuse, will be used as predictors for patient expressions of emotional distress during consultation. Therefore some regression and correlational analysis will be conducted. Similarly, only two pieces of information selected from the TOP questionnaire will be included for analysis for this study. First, the number of days patients injected non-prescribed drugs in the past four weeks obtained one months after the video recorded session. This information will be used as an indicator of a patient risk of suffering a drug overdose, as the primary outcome of the study. Frequency and duration of some behavioural data gathered from the consultation interaction (e.g., clinician's 'frowning', patient's 'looking down') will be correlated with this outcome variable (i.e., the number of days patients inject drugs). Second, patient's rating of overall quality of life obtained from the TOP questionnaire will be used to measure patient satisfaction as the secondary outcome of the study. Patient satisfaction will be also measured by a specifically developed questionnaire immediately after consultation. Again, some multiple regression analysis will be employed to explore relationship between predictor and outcome variables. Methods • Main ethical issues The main ethical issues involved in this study relate to the recording and storage of the images of clinicians and drug user patients and anonymity and confidentiality of participants' information. We have taken every possible steps to address these ethical issues and included some additional safeguard actions to deal with unexpected incidents. First, initial raw data recorded on DVDs will be locked in a metal case for temporary storage in the field and they will be secured in a locked cabinet in the University of St Andrews once transportation from the field to the University is complete. Second, each of the raw DVD files (i.e., each patient consultation) will be assigned a unique code and then be digitalized and stored on a university computer internal hard disc for coding and analysis. Third, these digitalized files will then be permanently removed from the computer once the coding and analysis is complete. They will be exported, after face images being digitally blurred, onto an external hard drive that will have all data encrypted and access to data files password protected. These encrypted data will be stored for two years following the end of the study and the original raw data on DVDs will be permanently destroyed at the end of the project. An audit record will be compiled to allow inspection of the progress of video data files from video DVD to computer hard disc for coding and then exporting to external media for safe long-term storage. Audit will be monitored by the School Ethics Committee on a 6-month basis. It is important to note that the faces of participants on the video data will be permanently digitally obscured after the coding has been completed. We will only display video files to a wider audience (e.g., at conferences) after face images have been blurred and informed consent from the relevant participants have been obtained. In order to protect anonymity of personal details and confidentiality of information provided by participants, we will assign a unique code to each participant so that participants will not be identified on the data files. This coding book will be locked in a secure place and only the research team members will have access. • Participants Sampling framework: In order to answer the research question of how aspects of clinician-patient interaction during addiction consultation predict drug misusers' risk of suffering a drug overdose, it seems that the population of interest is all clinicians and patients providing and using the addiction services in the UK. In practice, the ideal random sample or a proportionate stratified sample drawn from the population is often not feasible due to limited resource or time constraints. The sampling procedures adopted for the current study is a mix of opportunity and purposive sampling. Opportunities presented themselves in the form of patients being referred to the NHS Fife Addiction Services and all eligible staff members and patients based in the Whyteman's Brae service site will be invited to take part. Sampling is also purposive in that only the first session with a CDAS Addiction Nurse, where the patient is naive to the Addiction Nurse with regard to interaction experience, will be used to study the interaction. It is also considered important that sample patient participants should include approximately equal proportions of men and women; and the age profile should have representation from young and middle aged groups. Additionally, it is also important to consider some demographic information such as age, sex and working experience when sampling staff participants. Inclusion and exclusion criteria: All CDAS Addiction Nurses, who provide a one-to-one consultation service to patients, based in the Whyteman's Brae Hospital as part of the NHS Fife Addiction Services will be eligible. All patients referred to the NHS Fife Addiction Services by a Fife wide triage contact point or their GPs, who are to have a first session with their CDAS Addiction Nurses, will be eligible. Patient with mental health problems as well as those whose first language are not English will be excluded. Recruitment procedures: Staff participants are recruited through a combination of top-down and bottom-up approach. Meetings with head of the service and team leaders (top-down approach) and discussions with staff members (bottom-up approach) will take place simultaneously, to introduce the project and encourage participation. At the staff team meeting, information about the project and consent form with an opt-in reply slip will be left with them after the meeting so that they have time (about 3-4 days) to decide whether they are willing to participate. The consent forms will be returned to the research assistant in a prepaid and addressed envelope. We need a minimum number of 16 staff participants preferably with four male and four female between 25-65 years old. Newly qualified stff members are encouraged to participate as well as those more experiences ones. Obtaining patient consent will be achieved mainly through the help of the addiction services. An invitation package is delivered to all potential patient participants from the Addiction Services on behalf of the research team. As we need a minimum number of 16 consultation sessions (eight clinicians with two patients per clinician), the patient participants will preferably be eight women (four between 18-40 years old and four between 41-65 years old) and eight man (four between 18-40 years old and four between 41-65 years old). The invitation package will include an invitation letter, a project information sheet and a consent form. Patients will be also given 3-4 days before they decide to participate. The consent forms will be returned to the research assistant in a prepaid and addressed envelope. • Procedures of data collection Observations of clinician-patient interactions during the addiction consultation will take place at the consultation room at the Whyteman's Brae Hospital in Kirkcaldy in the form of audio-visual recording. The whole process of recording will take about 30 minutes depending on the complexity of individual cases. It is not expected that the presence of the camera and researchers will have any detrimental effect on the clinicians' delivery of the service, nor will this likely to upset the patients. We will use a small sized digital camera and place it in a good distance (approximately 2m from the clinician and the patient). The operation of the recording system will be well practised and the setup will be completed in good time to minimize any possible disturbance to the participants. The recording and storage of video files will strictly follow the ethical procedures described in the main ethical issues in this application form, such as digitally obscure the face images of relevant participants and secure data files in a locked cabinet. According to the research design (to collect a minimum of 16 consultation sessions with about eight staff participants with two patients per staff member) and the availability of the Addiction Nurses at the Whyteman's Brae Hospital, which is about 10 up to the date of this proposal, we expect that each Addiction Nurse will participate in an average number of approximately two video recording sessions, which will last about 60 minutes in total. This average 60-minute total observation time for each Addiction Nurse could spread out in 5 or 6 days depending on the appointment with his/her patients. The total participation time for each patient participant in the video recording session is about 30 minutes depending on the complexity of the case. If either the clinician or the patient feels unhappy with the recording at any point of the observation, the recording will be stopped immediately and any recorded data will be destroyed. The Overdose Risk Assessment Questionnaire and the Treatment Outcomes Profile Questionnaire will be implemented as part of the routine practice by the Addiction Nurses. The Patient Satisfaction Survey, specially developed for this study, is handed to the patient by the research assistant before the video observation. It can be completed within 5 minutes at the end of the consultation. Patients are advised to complete the survey with the absence of their clinicians and return it to the letter box placed at the Reception. This is to avoid possible pressure to provide positive comments in front their clinicians and protect confidentiality of the information. There will be no follow-up questions after this initial survey has been completed. • Data analysis All video data will be analysed using the Observer XT system. First, all verbal and non-verbal behaviours of both clinicians and patients will be coded using the modified VR-CoDES coding scheme. Both inter- and intra-coder reliabilities will be checked to a satisfactory level (i.e., Kappa ≥ .70). Second, frequency or duration of certain behaviours will be calculated to identify possible relationships between certain behaviours and outcome variables (i.e., risk of suffering a drug overdose and/or patient satisfaction). Third, sequential analyses will be employed to detect patterns of behaviours and identify more complex behavioural relationships. In addition, some coded behaviours will be exported to other statistical packages for further analyses such as SPSS. Data gathered from the survey method, such as patient satisfaction with the consultation and patent previous depression will be used as either outcome or predictor variables to be correlated with behavioural variables from the interactions.\",\n",

       "  'Developmental Clinical Studies - Reversing Endometrial Glucocorticoid Deficiency in Heavy Menstrual Bleeding',\n",
       "  'This study builds on previous research which has provided compelling evidence that deficient activity of glucocorticoids in the endometrium is a cause of increased menstrual bleeding. This study aims to demonstrate that a glucocorticoid (dexamethasone), already in common use for other conditions, (eg to treat medical conditions such as asthma and rheumatoid arthritis in early pregnancy), will reverse the endometrial glucocorticoid deficiency and as a result reduce menstrual blood loss. The study is in two stages, a 12 month workup stage and a 3 year, response adaptive, dose-finding randomised controlled trial. The first stage involves two workup clinical studies to gather preliminary safety and efficacy data from first-in-Heavy Menstrual Bleeding use of oral dexamethasone. They will also provide methodological data for a series of simulation studies to determine a robust adaptive trial design specification. Workup study 1: is unblinded, six patients will be given Dexamethasone (0.75mg twice daily) for 5 days during two consecutive menstrual cycles and will have an endometrial biopsy and MRI on two occasions (in a nontreated cycle, and the second of the cycles treated with Dexamethasone). Workup study 2; is a doubleblind crossover trial of 14 women -2 treatment blocks of two cycles each, with either placebo or Dexamethasone (0.75mg twice daily), randomised to order of treatments blocks - placebo then Dexamethasone, or vice-versa. Adaptive trial: 48 month double-blind, placebo controlled trial of 108 women to evaluate the effect of Dexamethasone across a range of doses with the aim of identifying the optimal dose to be studied in a subsequent Phase III trial. Participants will be randomised to receive one of 6 active doses or placebo over 3 menstrual cycles. All studies will involve asking participants to complete menstrual diaries and to carry out menstrual blood loss collections to objectively measure blood loss. The investigators\\' proposed approach is novel use of synthetic glucocorticoid to \"rescue\" luteal phase deficiency of cortisol, and thus improve endometrial vasculature and hence vasoconstriction when menses commences, and thus reduce menstrual bleeding.',\n",
       "  'Background Menstrual bleeding complaints affect quality of life and comprise a substantial societal burden, including major impact on health care use and costs. Current medical therapy for heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is often ineffective and/or associated with unacceptable side effects. There is unmet clinical need for targeted, effective, medical treatment strategies for HMB. The investigators\\' findings from research into mechanisms in HMB has led to the conclusion that women with HMB have enhanced endometrial inactivation of cortisol by 11βHSD2 resulting in local endometrial glucocorticoid deficiency, changes in prostaglandin (PG) production, and altered structure and deficient vasoconstriction of the endometrial vasculature. The investigators therefore anticipate that luteal phase \"rescue\" of endometrial glucocorticoid deficiency will provide a novel approach to therapy for women with HMB. The synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (Dex) is a potent cortisol surrogate and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) agonist that resists 11βHSD2 inactivation. In a non-human primate study the investigators have observed a striking reduction in menstrual blood loss after Dexamethasone administration. Objectives The investigators aim to show proof-of-concept that Dexamethasone administration in women with HMB will improve the capacity of endometrial vasculature for efficient vasoconstriction when menses commences, and hence reduce menstrual bleeding. The investigators\\' proposal is a novel use of an existing, well-characterised medical treatment (Dex). Methods The Investigators propose a parallel group randomised controlled trial in women with HMB comparing Dexamethasone (over a range of potential doses) to placebo treatment. The trial design will be response-adaptive, whereby randomisation probabilities change across time to ensure that maximum information is obtained in the critical region of the underlying dose-response curve (that containing the \\'optimum\\' dose). This has the added advantage that relatively more and more women are randomised to the doses emerging as most effective. Such a design is the most parsimonious way to enable both robust demonstration of the therapeutic effect of Dexamethasone on HMB, and reliable identification of the optimal dose to take forward for future further study in a Phase III trial. Work Up Stage Adaptive designs such as this require a work up stage to enable the simulation modelling necessary to determine a robust final design specification with adequate power (here, the expected number of patients required lies in the range 100-108). In addition this work up stage will allow two clinical studies to be executed. Data collected in these will inform the modelling and simulation, but will also enhance mechanistic and pharmacodynamic understanding of observed Dexamethasone effect, and will be an invaluable preliminary check of safety of this \\'first-in-HMB\\' use of oral Dexamethasone. These studies will involve treating in total 20 women with HMB with two cycles of Dexamethasone (1.5mg daily).',\n",

       "  'Objective: Demonstrate the safety of early use of dabigatran following TIA/minor stroke. Background: Although aggressive antithrombotic therapy has been shown to reduce the number of new ischemic events following stroke/TIA, this has always been offset by an increase in the risk of hemorrhagic transformation. Dabigatran is much safer than previously tested antithrombotic agents, with respect to intracranial bleeding and therefore offers a unique treatment opportunity in these high-risk patients. TIA/minor stroke represent the largest group of cerebrovascular disease patients. A short-term intervention such as 30 days of dabigatran treatment has the potential for a very large impact from the population health perspective, given the number of patients who may be treated if a benefit can be demonstrated. Study design: This is an open label, single arm study. Patients with TIA/minor stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score </=3) who can be treated within 24 hours of symptom onset will be eligible. All patients will be treated with dabigatran for 30 days. The dose of dabigatran will be determined by age and renal function (patients >80 years old and/or with GFR 30-50 ml/min will received 110 mg bid, and all other patients will receive 150 mg BID).The primary endpoint is symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation. Patients (n=50) with TIA/minor stroke, defined as having a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale Score of </=3, will undergo an MRI, including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), as well as gradient recall echo (GRE) sequences, which will be used to assess for hemorrhagic transformation. Patients will have a repeat MRI examination at 7 and 30 days to assess for hemorrhagic transformation and new lesion development. The primary endpoint of of phase I is symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation, defined as a parenchymal hematoma on the day 7 MRI scan (GRE sequence), associated with clinical worsening (>/=4 point increase in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score). If dabigatran can be used safely in this population, a second phase aimed at demonstrating the rate of new ischemic lesion development following TIA can be reduced with aggressive antithrombotic therapy. A randomized open-label, blinded endpoint evaluation design will be employed. The investigators hypothesize that dabigatran therapy administered within 24 hours of symptom onset will reduce the rate of new ischemic lesions, relative to standard care, one week and 30 days after onset.',\n",
       "  \"Background: A transient ischemic attack (TIA) has traditionally been defined as a focal neurologic deficit lasting less than 24 hours, but alternative definitions based on tissue injury have been more recently proposed.1 This clinical definition has been based on the assumption that TIAs are associated with complete resolution of brain ischemia occurring rapidly enough to cause only transient symptoms and no permanent brain injury, i.e. stroke. A recently completed MRI research study at the University of Alberta indicates that TIA and minor stroke actually represent a continuum of symptoms secondary to brain ischemia.2 There is also substantial evidence that the period shortly after a TIA or minor stroke is one of elevated recurrent stroke risk; as high as 17% at 3 months.3, 4 We have previously reported that MRI markers of new infarction are actually present within 7 days of the index event in 18% of patients.2 TIA and minor stroke can therefore be seen as a sentinel warning for impending major stroke, which offers a potential window for therapeutic intervention. Given the large number of patients who suffer a TIA/minor stroke, it is important to identify and target those patients at highest risk for early recurrence. Treatment of Minor Stroke/TIA: A logical approach to prevent early recurrence is aggressive hyperacute antithrombotic therapy following TIA/minor stroke, as is now the standard of care in acute coronary syndrome management. This treatment strategy is aimed at preventing both recurrent thromboembolism and propagation of existing thrombi. In acute coronary syndrome patients, antithrombotic therapy consists of both anticoagulants (low molecular weight heparin) and combination antiplatelet agents (ASA+high dose clopidogrel, or more recently prasugrel/ticagrelor). In ischemic stroke patients the benefits of traditional anticoagulants, particularly heparin, have been consistently offset by an increased incidence of intracranial hemorrhagic complications.5 Combination antiplatelet therapy is sometimes used empirically following TIA/minor stroke, although this may not be an ideal approach either. A previous trial in 392 patients demonstrated a trend towards reduction of recurrent events by day 90 when patients were treated with a combination of ASA and clopidogrel for 90 days (Absolute Risk Reduction = 3.3% [95% CI -1.9, 9.4]), but this was also complicated by excess hemorrhagic events. The direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran is a very effective antithrombotic agent that has been shown to be superior to warfarin in the prevention of cardioembolic ischemic stroke. Dabigatran is unique in that unlike other antithrombotic drugs studied in cerebrovascular disease, it appears to be associated with a much lower risk of intracranial hemorrhagic complications, including intracerebral and subdural hemorrhages.7 This therefore appears to be an ideal drug for treatment of acute cerebrovascular syndrome patients. MRI as a Surrogate Outcome Marker in TIA/Minor Stroke: Our previous serial MRI study indicates that the rate of new DWI lesion development in a TIA and minor stroke population is 22% at 30 days and more importantly 92% of these lesions developed within the first 7 days after the initial symptoms.2 The majority (90%) of patients who developed new lesions had baseline DWI lesions and all had areas of hypoperfusion evident on perfusion images. Thus stroke 'recurrence' in fact appears to represent completion of the natural history of an acute cerebrovascular syndrome. Having identified this high-risk group of patients, we now aim to reduce the rate of development of new lesions. DWI lesion load has been shown to be highly predictive of neurological and functional recovery following ischemic stroke, making this an ideal surrogate outcome marker in smaller phase IIa studies. The investigators have designed a two-phase study aimed at demonstrating the safety (phase I) and efficacy (phase II) of acute dabigatran treatment following TIA/minor ischemic stroke. Phase I is described below. The final design of phase II will be dependent on the results of Phase I. Study Aim and Design Phase I: The primary aim of phase I is to demonstrate the safety of early use of dabigatran following TIA/minor stroke. Phase I is an open label, single arm study. Patients with TIA/minor stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score >/=3) who can be treated within 24 hours of symptom onset will be eligible. All patients will be treated with dabigatran for 30 days. The dose of dabigatran will be determined by age and renal function (patients >80 years old and/or with GFR 30-50 ml/min will received 110 mg bid, and all other patients will receive 150 mg BID).The primary endpoint is symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation. Patients (n=50) with TIA/minor stroke, defined as having a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale Score of </=3, will undergo an MRI, including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), as well as gradient recall echo (GRE) sequences, which will be used to assess for hemorrhagic transformation. Patients will have a repeat MRI examination at 7 and 30 days to assess for hemorrhagic transformation and new lesion development. The primary endpoint of of phase I is symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation, defined as a parenchymal hematoma on the day 7 MRI scan (GRE sequence), associated with clinical worsening (>/=4 point increase in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score). Sample Size: Phase I is an open label, single arm study. The primary endpoint is symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation. A total of 50 patients will be treated with dabigatran. A priori stopping rules, based on the expected number of patients experiencing hemorrhagic transformation in a group this size, will be employed.\",\n",

We will collect respiratory droplets shed by participants while breathing normally, talking, and spontaneously coughing. We will characterize the size distribution of droplets containing infectious virus. We will use these basic data to examine the roles of large and small respiratory droplets and examine how the interaction of host factors and virus type impact the shedding of infectious respiratory droplets. Subjects will be recruited through a web based respiratory illness surveillance system, health clinics and advertisement in the campus community. Sitting in the collection booth will not create additional discomfort or risk for volunteers already suffering from influenza infection. We will recruit up to 1000 persons with symptoms of acute respiratory illness for screening with collection of nasopharyngeal swabs and questionnaire. From among those screened, we will recruit 250 to give exhaled breath samples, and ask 50 people with influenza to return for follow up exhaled breath samples on up to two subsequent days. We hypothesize that (1) fine aerosols (<5 microns in aerodynamic diameter) will contain more viral copies than coarse aerosol particles (>= 5 microns) (2) fine aerosols will contain culturable virus indicating that the fine aerosols are infectious, (3) aerosol shedding will correlate with virus load measured by swabs, (4) presence of active cough during sampling will be associated with increased aerosol shedding, (5) clinical symptoms and signs, including fever can be used to predict viral aerosol shedding.',\n",

To determine the safety and feasibility of infusing gene-modified, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-protected hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) after high-dose chemotherapy for treatment of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related lymphoma. II. To determine the dose of carmustine (BCNU) in combination with O^6-benzylguanine (O6BG) that results in selection in vivo of gene-modified HIV-resistant cells. III. To estimate the effect of HIV infection on the presence of HIV-resistant blood cells as measured by genetic marking for vector sequences before and after antiviral treatment interruption. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the molecular and clonal composition of gene-modified cells after hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT). II. Evaluate the molecular and clonal composition of gene-modified cells after O6BG/BCNU. III. Determine the correlation of the level of O6-methylguanine- methyltransferase (MGMT) (P140K) marking with toxicity and response. IV. Characterize the toxicity associated with in vivo selection. V. Determine the efficacy of the procedure for treatment of lymphoma: defined as time to disease progression, progression-free survival, treatment-related mortality, time to neutrophil and platelet recovery, and incidence of infections. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. Effect of procedure on the latent HIV reservoir. II. Effect of procedure on HIV-specific immune reconstitution.

       "  'Children in resource-limited settings are increasing experiencing treatment failure, as defined by virologic, immunologic, and/or clinical criteria. There are few studies of HIV resistance mutations in children failing first line NNRTI therapy in resource limited settings. The emergence of treatment failure and drug resistance in children on ART emphasizes the urgency for developing evidence-based second-line and salvage treatment strategies. Pediatric treatment is complicated by a number of factors, including having fewer numbers of ARVs approved by drug safety agencies and the lack of pediatric formulations. This further shortens the list of available second-line ARVs as compared to adults. Despite the growing number of children on second-line therapy worldwide, there are limited data on efficacy of second-line PI therapy in children after NRTI-NNRTI failure. There are currently no options for third-line/salvage regimens for children in resource-limited settings. New drugs and drug classes are approved for use in children by the US FDA but are not routinely available outside of high-income settings. Also, there are no data on the resistance patterns of children failing second-line therapy in resource-limited settings to guide clinical management and ARV procurement. Clinicians need evidence-based guidelines for how to manage children with treatment failure, and access to the drugs necessary to construct potent and durable third-line regimens. TASER-P is a longitudinal observational cohort study to monitor for treatment failure to second-line ART in Asian children.',\n",

       "  'Intimate partner violence is a serious public health problem that disproportionately affects drug-involved female offenders under community supervision. Moreover, accumulating research has found strong associations linking experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV) and continued drug use among women in drug treatment. This research suggests that failure to prevent IPV among drug-involved female offenders under community supervision likely to result in higher rates of relapse, treatment attrition and recidivism and underscores the need to address the IPV service needs among the rapidly growing population of female offenders under community supervision. Computerized multimedia IPV prevention service tools have been shown to be feasible and effective in conducting screening, brief intervention and referral for IPV in medical care settings. The proposed services research addresses the significant public health problem of IPV victimization and a co-occurring risk for relapse and recidivism among drug-involved female offenders under court supervision or probation. The proposed computerized tool employs a self-paced, multimedia format to conduct IPV screening, brief intervention and IPV-related service referrals that is informed by best IPV screening and referral practices and previous intervention research. This innovative tool represents a cost-effective option that may implemented with greater fidelity and result in better client satisfaction and IPV prevention outcomes. Furthermore, if found to be effective in identifying IPV and improving linkage to IPV services, this cost effective computerized service tool may be scaled up with ease and speed in court and probation settings in New York State and nationwide.',\n",

       "  'Phase I The goal of the phase I part of the study is to determine the maximum tolerated doses of methotrexate and cytarabine able to be combined with once-per-cycle rituximab and full-dose 3-weeks-on/1-week-off lenalidomide in 28-day treatment cycles. Methotrexate and cytarabine will be given three times per cycle, preferably on days 1, 8 and 15. If short-term toxicity precludes once-per-week dosing, treatment may be delayed by a maximum of 3 days, e.g. the second injection of methotrexate and cytarabine may be delayed until day 11 and the third injection until day 21. The doses of methotrexate and cytarabine will be adjusted to permit administration of three doses per cycle without the need to postpone the subsequent treatment cycle by more than 7 days. Dose limiting toxicity will be determined by increasing the doses of methotrexate and cytarabine in sequential patient cohorts in a 3 + 3 design. Because tolerance to lenalidomide and cytotoxic agents are likely to decrease with increasing numbers of treatment cycles, evaluation of dose-limiting toxicity will be confined to the first two cycles. The requirement for dose reductions in subsequent treatment cycles will not be rated as dose-limiting toxicity. If no dose-limiting toxicity is observed in 3 patients treated at the same dose level, the next 3 patients will be treated at the next higher dose level. If a single patient experiences dose-limiting toxicity, another 3 patients will be treated at the same dose level. If no more than one dose-limiting toxicity is observed in 6 patients treated at that level, the next 3 patients will be treated at the subsequent dose level. If two or more of 3 - 6 patients treated at the same level experience dose-limiting toxicity, dose escalation will be stopped. The dose level below the level where dose-limiting toxicity was observed defines the maximum tolerated dose. The dose level below the level where dose-limiting toxicity is observed defines the maximum tolerated doses of methotrexate and cytarabine. However, if, at a lenalidomide dose of 25 mg, methotrexate and cytarabine cannot be escalated beyond the first dose level, the lenalidomide dose will be reduced to 20 mg, and the methotrexate/cytarabine dose level producing dose-limiting toxicity will be repeated at a lenalidomide dose of 20 mg. If, at a lenalidomide dose of 20 mg, methotrexate and cytarabine cannot be escalated beyond the first dose level, the lenalidomide dose will be reduced to 15 mg, and the methotrexate/cytarabine dose level producing dose-limiting toxicity will be repeated with a lenalidomide dose of 15 mg. If, at a lenalidomide dose of 15 mg, methotrexate and cytarabine cannot be escalated beyond the first dose level, dose limiting toxicity is reached and the maximum tolerated dose is the highest dose of lenalidomide able to be combined with the first dose level of methotrexate and cytarabine in a 3 + 3 phase I design. The toxicity profiles of methotrexate (mucositis, hepatotoxicity) and cytarabine (hematotoxicity, hepatotoxicity) differ. In order to determine the maximum tolerated dose of each compound, further dose escalation of one or other drug may be required after the maximum tolerated dose of the methotrexate/cytarabine combination (as defined in dose levels 1 - 5, see below) has been determined. If dose-limiting hematotoxicity occurs without concomitant dose-limiting mucositis or hepatotoxicity, the dose of methotrexate may be escalated without concomitant increase of the cytarabine dose. Conversely, if severe mucositis occurs without concomitant dose-limiting hematotoxicity or hepatotoxicity, the dose of cytarabine may be escalated without concomitant increase of the methotrexate dose. Dose modifications of individual drugs will be made by the coordinating principal investigator according to the observed toxicities using the levels defined for the methotrexate/cytarabine combination. Toxicities observed during the first two treatment cycles will be reported to the trial office within 7 days after their occurrence (in case of serious adverse events within 24 hours). Based on the predefined criteria listed below the coordinating principal investigator and the trial coordinator will decide whether or not a toxicity fulfils the requirements of a dose-limiting toxicity. After inclusion of up to 6 patients on the same dose level the coordinating principal investigator and the trial coordinator will decide according to the principles outlined in this protocol whether it is safe to move on to the next dose level. If rating a toxicity as dose-limiting is equivocal and/or no agreement is obtained between the coordinating principal investigator and the trial coordinator, the principal investigators of all participating trial sites will be included in the decision making process. Stepping-up to the next dose level will require more votes to be in favor of than against dose escalation. Dose-limiting toxicities are: - any of the following on the day of methotrexate/cytarabine injection (day 8 + ≤ 3 days / day 15 + ≤ 6 days of the first or second treatment cycle; day 1 of the second or third cycle which is equivalent to day 29 + ≤ 7 days of the previous cycle): neutrophils < 500/µl, platelets < 25.000/µl, creatinine clearance < 60 ml/min, bilirubin ≥ 3,0 mg/dl, serum AST/GOT or ALT/GPT ≥ 6 x upper limit of normal, mucositis grade 3 or 4 - requirement for dose reduction of methotrexate/cytarabine in the first or second treatment cycle - fewer than 21 days of lenalidomide in the first or second treatment cycle - toxicity-related delay of second or third treatment cycle by more than 7 days - any other toxicity preventing continuation of therapy according to protocol in the first or second treatment cycle (except allergic reactions) Depending on previous treatment history patients will vary in their tolerance to the LeMLAR regimen. To provide maximum therapeutic benefit, the doses of methotrexate and cytarabine will be escalated within individual patients after cycles 2 and 4 as detailed below provided no dose limiting toxicities occurred in previous treatment cycles. Dose escalation in cycles 3 to 6 in individual patients will not be used to determine dose-limiting toxicity. This will only be done in cycles 1 and 2. Patients should receive 6 treatment cycles unless tumor progression, unacceptable toxicity or treatment intolerance occurs. Treatment intolerance includes physician or patient preference to discontinue or change treatment in a manner not compatible with the protocol. If treatment according to the LeMLAR protocol is prematurely stopped, its result must be documented by the procedures outlined in the protocol.

       "  'In the FARAMIS study, we aim to investigate the longitudinal course of intestinal plasma fatty acid binding protein (i-FABP) in patients with acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) undergoing primary percutaneous angiographic intervention. The investigators postulate that patients with fully re-established intestinal blood flow and vital intestines will display a significant drop of plasmatic i-FABP within 24 hours, while patients requiring subsequent intestinal resection due to irreversible bowel necrosis will not. If true, patients requiring laparotomy and bowel resection could be identified and patients in whom angiographic intervention led to successful cure of disease would not be exposed to potentially perilous surgery.',\n",
       "  'Intestinal plasma fatty acid binding proteins (i-FABP) have been introduced as a powerful marker for the diagnosis of intestinal ischemia. Based on several small studies, this marker is referred to as a sensitive indicator for intestinal ischemia. I-FABP is characterized by its short half-time of eleven minutes in blood circulation, which might allow \"real-time\" monitoring of necrotic intestinal segments. Subjects meeting the in-/exclusion criteria will undergo five to six blood collections: one baseline assessment before revascularization, three assessments directly after angiographic intervention (5/30/120 minutes), and one assessment after 24 hours. An additional blood collection will be performed in patients who underwent subsequent surgery. In addition, clinical exams of the patient are carried out. Subjects will be observed for 72 hours after percutaneous revascularization and retrospectively classified depending on the clinical course: recovering patients or patients undergoing surgery without signs of necrotic segments will be attributed to group A. Patients in whom intestinal necrosis is confirmed by surgery or autopsy will belong to group B. For all patients, clinical and laboratory findings will be reported in a descriptive manner. To evaluate whether the post-interventional course of plasmatic i-FABP is a reliable predictor for successful revascularization, the minimum level of i-FABP at the time points 5, 30 and 120 Minutes is divided by the baseline (= before intervention) level of i-FABP. This ratio (R) reflects the decrease (or increase) of i-FABP after revascularization. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC)-analysis will be carried out and the area under the curve will be determined for different R-values (e.g. 0.3, 0.5, 0.7). We postulate that patients with fully re-established intestinal blood flow and vital intestines will display a significant drop of plasmatic i-FAPB within 24 hours, while patients requiring subsequent intestinal resection due to irreversible bowel necrosis will not.',\n",

       "  'In 2010, more than 35,000 people died in the United Kingdom from lung cancer, the majority from non-small cell cancer (NSCLC). Chemotherapy is one of the main treatments for patients with NSCLC but those treated will still only live for an average of 9 or 10 months after diagnosis. The purpose of this clinical trial is to find out whether or not giving a drug called Olaparib following chemotherapy will benefit patients with NSCLC who have responded to initial chemotherapy treatment by prolonging the time before the tumour regrows. Olaparib is a new, oral drug developed by AstraZeneca which may help to slow down cancer growth. The rationale for this clinical trial is that chemotherapy damages tumour cell DNA and NSCLC tumours that respond to chemotherapy are less able to repair this damage. This can be exploited by using Olaparib as it blocks an enzyme called Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) which is essential for DNA repair. This will prevent DNA repair and cause cancer cell death by a mechanism known as synthetic lethality. Synthetic lethality arises when a combination of mutation in two or more genes leads to cell death. Up to 300 patients who are to receive standard chemotherapy treatment will be initially registered into the trial. Of these patients, 114 patients who have responded to chemotherapy will be randomly allocated to receive either Olaparib or an inactive dummy pill or placebo by mouth. The trial will assess whether Olaparib delays disease progression following standard chemotherapy treatment in patients.

The prognosis of this group of patients with mild stenosis remains to be investigated in more detail, and we propose that psychosocial factors play a role in the clinical prognosis and patient reported outcomes in this group. A special focus lies within examining personality characteristics, of which Type D personality is a primary predictor variable for prognosis. Type D personality is characterised by high negative affect and high social inhibition.

       "  \"Abstract: Colorectal cancer is amongst the leading cancers worldwide. Treatment is greatly dependent on the stage of illness, with more favorable outcomes associated with early cancers. For this reason, screening colonoscopies have been increasing, as are efforts to improve the quality of bowel preparations. The colonoscopy accuracy and safety depend on the quality of colon cleansing. An inadequately prepped bowel will increase the risk of missing a lesion, prolong procedure, increase patient discomfort, and eventually increase complication rate. Hence, an Ideal bowel cleansing solution would quickly and reliably clean the colon while having a good tolerability and palatability to the patient. Current colonoscopy preparation regimens require the use of large volume of iso-osmotic PEG-electrolyte solution for adequate cleansing and are often poorly tolerated by patients. We have shown previously that mentholyptus drops significantly improved the palatability of PEG-electrolyte (Fortrans®) solution and the quality of preparation (1). We aim at this study to compare the efficacy of the above-mentioned prep technique and the reduced volume ascorbic acid-supplemented PEG-electrolyte (MoviPrep®). This is a randomized controlled trial that will include patients undergoing elective colonoscopy at the American University of Beirut Medical Center. Patients will be randomized into one of two study arms using a computer generated randomization list. 100 Patients will be asked to have candy (Halls®) during the whole 2 hours period while drinking the PEG solution (Fortrans®). Another 100 patients will be asked to take reduced volume ascorbic acid-supplemented PEG-electrolyte (MoviPrep®). All patients will then be interviewed by the research coordinator to evaluate the tolerability of the preparation while taking into account the palatability of the solution as main outcome and the remaining volume of the PEG solution and side effects as secondary outcomes. Based on the results of a pilot study, our sample size calculation showed that 100 patients per arm will be enough to attain significance. As for the statistical analysis, SPSS version 20.0 will be used for data entry and analysis. I- Aim: To compare the efficacy of split PEG-electrolyte (Fortrans®) with mentholyptus (Halls®) drops and the reduced volume ascorbic acid-supplemented PEG-electrolyte (MoviPrep®) in improving the palatability of solution used in bowel cleansing for colonoscopy. II- Background: The colonoscopy accuracy and safety depend on the quality of colon cleansing. An inadequately prepped bowel will increase the risk of missing a lesion, prolong procedure, increase patient discomfort, and eventually increase complication rate. Therefore an excellent colon cleansing is of extreme importance to the endoscopist and the patient. Hence, An Ideal bowel cleansing solution would quickly and reliably clean the colon while having a good tolerability and palatability to the patient. Poor tolerability by the patient would increase the risk of not finishing the whole solution and hence the risk of having a poor colon cleansing. Many types of bowel cleansing solutions are currently available in the market. Current colonoscopy preparation regimens require the use of large volume of iso-osmotic PEG-electrolyte solution for adequate cleansing and are often poorly tolerated by patients. Therefore, improving the tolerability of the solution by patients is of critical importance. The main side effects of bowel cleansing solution are nausea, vomiting, bloating, and cramps. To decrease their incidence and therefore to improve tolerability, one could either decrease the volume of the solution or improve its palatability. Many studies have tried to decrease the volume of the solution below the standard 4 liters. These studies have largely shown that smaller volume preps are inferior to standard preps. In addition, few studies have shown that improving palatability by adding a flavor improved patients' acceptance of the solution (2-6). MoviPrep® is the only liquid PEG bowel cleansing agent that incorporates ascorbic acid in its formulation, thus contributing to its lemon taste and consequently better patient tolerability. We have proved earlier this year through a randomized trial a high palatability of and hence a better quality of preparation (90% Good/Excellent) using the PEG-electrolyte Fortrans® with sugar-free mentholyptus drops (Halls®) (6). We aim at comparing the colonoscopy preparation quality and the palatability of our technique and that of the MoviPrep® through a single blinded randomized trial. III- Hypothesis: Split Fortrans® prep with sugar-free mentholyptus drops (Halls®) has a better palatability and tolerability than the reduced volume ascorbic acid-supplemented PEG-electrolyte (MoviPrep®) in bowel cleansing for colonoscopy. IV- Setting: Single university based center (American University of Beirut Medical Center) V- Study Design: Prospective randomized single-blinded study VI- Methods: 1. Study population: 1. Inclusion criteria: ● Elective colonoscopy - Consent to the study 2. Exclusion criteria: ● Pregnant or lactating women ● Age less than 18 years ● Significant gastroparesis ● Gastric outlet obstruction ● Ileus ● Known or suspected bowel obstruction or perforation ● Phenylketonuria - Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency - Severe chronic renal failure (creatinine clearance <30 mL/minute) - Severe congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class III or IV) - Dehydration - Severe acute inflammatory disease - Compromised swallowing reflex or mental status - Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥170 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure ≥100 mm Hg) - Toxic colitis or megacolon These exclusion criteria are consistent with contraindications of currently approved bowel preparations; therefore, the results of this study may be generalized to the entire target population of patients undergoing colonoscopy, including the elderly. 2. Randomization: Patients will be enrolled by the principal investigator or study coordinator (MD) after assessing for inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients will then be randomized into one of the two study arms using a pre-set randomization list where patients with an odd number as the last digit of their medical record will be assigned to the control arm and patients with an even number will be assigned to the intervention arm. 3. Study arms: ● First arm: 4 Liters of PEG solution (FORTRANS®) split into 2 days with sugar-free mentholyptus drops (2 L at 7-9 pm on the day prior to the colonoscopy with Halls®, and 2 L on the day of the colonoscopy to be completed at least 1.5 hours before the procedure with Halls®). ● Second arm: 2 Liters of reduced volume ascorbic acid-supplemented PEG-electrolyte (MoviPrep®) + 1 Liter of clear fluids of the patients' choice split into 2 days (1 L of MoviPrep® on the evening of the day prior to the colonoscopy + 500 mL of clear fluids of the patients choice, and another 1 L of MoviPrep® + 500 mL of clear fluids on the day of the colonoscopy to be completed at least 1 hour before the procedure.) 4. Instructions to patients: Patients in both arms will be instructed on how they should take the colonoscopy preparation solution, emphasizing the importance of complete intake of the solution in order to ensure a safe and effective procedure. In case of noncompliance, the remainder of the PEG solution shall be brought in by the patient for assessment. They will also be instructed to have a regular breakfast and lunch meals on the day prior to the colonoscopy, a full fluid dinner, and to stay NPO except for the colon prep after midnight till the time of colonoscopy. 5. Assessment of tolerability: Immediately prior to the colonoscopy, patients from both study arms will be interviewed by the research coordinator to evaluate tolerability of the preparation. Patients will be assessed for: - Primary outcome: - Quality of preparation: score from 1 to 4 1. 2 3 4 Poor Fair Good Excellent - Secondary outcome: - Estimated volume remaining of the original PEG solution - Palatability: score 1 to 5 1. 2 3 4 5 Disgusting Moderately poor taste Slightly poor taste Acceptable Tasty In addition to the following adverse events: - Nausea - Vomiting - Bloating - Cramps - Headache - General acceptance of the solution - Willingness to take the preparation again in the future if necessary VII- Sample size calculation and data analysis: Sample size calculation was conducted based on our previously conducted study that showed a 90% good/excellent prep with Fortrans® + Halls® and the reported results on colonoscopy preparations using the reduced volume ascorbic acid-supplemented PEG-electrolyte (MoviPrep®) that range between 65-85% good/excellent (average: 75%) (1)(7-10). Therefore, based on these results and using an α of 0.05 and a power of 0.80, the sample size required to show significance was calculated to be 97 patients per arm. Hence, it was decided to recruit 100 patients per arm taking into account possible withdrawals. For the statistical analysis, SPSS version 20.0 will be used for data entry and analysis. The primary end point is the quality of preparation assessed by the endoscopist (who will be blind to the preparation technique). Secondary end points will be: palatability, residual volume, patient assessment of the quality of preparation, willingness to retake the preparation solution again if needed.

       "  'The conventional bedside pulse oximeter has been a standard in clinical care for non-invasive hemodynamic monitoring and measures arterial blood oxygenation. To date, a non-invasive bedside monitor for measuring mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) has not been developed. The clinical applications of venous oximetry are numerous and include management of severe sepsis and septic shock, trauma and hemorrhagic shock, heart failure and cardiac arrest. The existing method for venous blood oxygenation monitored is either through an invasive fiber optic catheter, or intermittently by blood sampling through a central venous catheter Oximetry. However, SvO2 measurements using fiber optic catheters are very expensive, and all central line insertions include inherent risks. Also, insertion of a central line is in some circumstances not feasible (e.g. discomfort/limited experience in central line insertion, unavailability of specific monitoring systems etc.) resulting in inappropriate therapy usually guided by SvO2. Therefore, a non-invasive monitor to measure SvO2 at the bedside negating the requirement for a central line insertion would be of clinical benefit and allow appropriate therapy of many patients listed above at a time when therapy has the most benefit. The Mespere VA Oximeter is a non-invasive medical device for monitoring of venous blood oxygenation. Continuous measurement of venous oxygenation will be beneficial because it will help the physician better understand local ischemia as well as provide better guidance for the physician to be able to best treat the patient and decrease their burden of illness.',\n",

       "  'Aim of this study is to comprehensively assess in healthy volunteers the metabolic processes and factors that define drug response. Sources of variability are to be investigated and factors that can alter the hepatic metabolism and the pharmacokinetics of drugs shall be quantified. Determination of variability is important when the pharmacokinetics of new drugs is being investigated and when the concept of individualized medicine is to be further developed. It is important to identify and differentiate between pharmaceutical, physiological (e.g. liver blood flow, renal function), environmental (e.g. foods and lifestyle), and genetic sources of inter-individual variability. For instance, inaccurate or false conclusions may be drawn from a single pharmacokinetic study, if the investigated medicine is metabolized by an enzyme with large inter-individual variability. Knowing the causes of variability and of the quantitative contribution of various processes might help to improve the oral formulations of drugs, might help selecting the right preclinical tests and selection criteria during clinical development, provide the basis to understand the influence of disease and to optimize established drug treatments in order to make future drug treatment safer and more efficient. This study is designed as an add-on to the study \"TWINS: Open Label Repeated Dose Study for the Evaluation of Heritability of and Genetic Influences on Drug Pharmacokinetics\" (Eudra-CT: 2008-006223-31). Twins are not a random sample of the population, and they differ in their developmental environment. In this sense they are not representative for the population Thus, the results of TWINS cannot be automatically generalized but instead require validation in a representative population sample.

       "  'Stria is a very common condition that affects psychologically and aesthetically a lot of patients. It is a linear atrophic scar. So, to be treated, it needs to have both a superficial and a deep impact. Several technologies have already been tested for this indication, but none of them have been proved at the same time effective and without a high risk of side effects for all skin types. As radiofrequency is an electrical current, it is not absorbed and does not see melanin. So it can be used on all skin types. When using fractional bipolar radiofrequency, the current goes from small electrodes to return electrodes. Around the small electrodes appear some epidermal ablation, coagulation and deeper thermal damage. This means it has a superficial and a deep effect. Using infrared combined with bipolar radiofrequency allows the infrared to pre-heat the skin so as to help the radiofrequency to go deeper in the skin more easily. This has a deep effect in the dermis. In this study, both technologies will be used. At least 20 patients will be treated in two different sites. The abdomen of each patient will be divided in four quadrants around the navel. Each quadrant will receive a total of three treatments one month apart: - One quadrant will be the control (no treatment will be done) - One quadrant will receive each time only bipolar radiofrequency potentiated by infrared - One quadrant will receive each time only fractional bipolar radiofrequency - One quadrant will receive each time first bipolar radiofrequency potentiated by infrared, followed in the same session by fractional bipolar radiofrequency. The choice of the treatment for each area will be randomized at the enrollment of the patient in the study. There will be two follow-up sessions 3 and 6 months after the last treatment. The evaluation will be done mainly by 3D acquisitions. This will allow measuring the length, width and depth of the striae and evaluating their evolution after the treatment.

       "  'This research study is a Phase II clinical trial, which tests the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug called Regadenoson (or Lexiscan) to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific disease, in this case Sickle Cell Disease (SCD). \"Investigational\" means that the drug is being studied. It also means that the FDA has not yet approved the drug for your type of disease. SCD is an inherited blood disorder that causes the red blood cells to change their shape from a round shape to a half-moon/crescent or sickled shape. People who have SCD have a different type of protein that carries oxygen in their blood (hemoglobin) than people without SCD. This different type of hemoglobin makes the red blood cells change into crescent shape under certain conditions. Sickle-shaped cells are a problem because they often get stuck in the blood vessels blocking the flow of blood, and cause inflammation and injury to important areas in the body. Regadenoson (trade name Lexiscan) is a drug that may prevent this inflammation and injury caused by the sickle shaped cells. This drug is approved by the FDA to be used as a fast infusion during a heart stress test in people who are unable to exercise enough to put stress on their heart by making the heart beat faster. Regadenoson has been studied as a long infusion at this dose in adults, and no safety issues have been identified (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01085201). This is the first study to look at patient benefit with the long infusion of the drug. This drug has been used in laboratory experiments and information from those other research studies suggests that this drug may help to protect the body from damage caused by sickle-shaped cells in this research study. In this research study, the investigators are specifically looking to see if Regadenoson is an effective treatment for pain crises and acute chest syndrome in SCD.',\n",
       "  'If you are willing to participate in this research study you will be asked to undergo some screening tests and procedures to confirm your eligibility. Many of these tests and procedures are likely to be part of regular sickle cell anemia care and may be done even if it turns out that you do not take part in the research study. If you have had some of these tests and procedures recently, they may or may not have to be repeated. The tests and procedures include: a medical history, physical examination, blood tests, blood or urine pregnancy test (if applicable) and an electrocardiogram. If these tests show that you are eligible to participate in the research study, you will begin the study treatment. If you do not meet the eligibility criteria, you will not be able to participate in the research study. At the time of screening we will also ask you about your pain level. Because no one knows which of the study options is best, you will be \"randomized\" into one of the study groups: the \"study drug\" group, which will receive Regadenoson, or the \"control\" group, which will receive placebo. Randomization means that you are put into a group by chance. It is like flipping a coin. Neither you nor the research doctor will choose what group you will be in. You will have an equal (50/50) chance of being placed in either group. Neither you nor the research doctor will know what group you are in. You will be given a study medication and it will contain either Regadenoson or placebo (fluids with no medicine). You will be given one infusion of the study drug while you are admitted to the hospital for a pain crisis. The study drug will be infused with fluids. You will stay in the hospital for at least 3 days and 2 nights. Your infusion will be 48 hours long, followed by a 6-hour observation period. During your infusion, you will receive standard treatment for your pain crisis. The study drug will be given through a separate part of your body from the infusions that are part of your standard treatment. The study drug will not be available after your participation in the study ends. Before the infusion: We will place a small tube in your vein called an IV, which will be used only to infuse the study drug. It will not be used for infusions that are part of standard treatment for your pain crisis. During the study drug infusion, standard treatment will be given through a separate IV. We can use your standard treatment IV or a needle to draw blood for the required blood test. If it is hard to draw blood from your veins, we may ask you if you would like to use a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC line) for your blood draws. A PICC line is a small tube that is placed in a vein in your arm and goes through to a vein in your chest. A chest x-ray is usually done to make sure it is in the right veins. It is your choice to decide whether you would like to use a PICC line. We will record your blood pressure and heart rate every 5-10 minutes, until they have stabilized. We will also ask you about your pain level at the time of your blood test. During the 48 hour infusion: Your heart rate and the amount of oxygen in your blood will be monitored continuously using a device that fits over your finger. We will take about 2-3 teaspoons of blood at 24 and 48 hours after the beginning of your infusion for tests to try to understand how the drug affects your body. We will ask you about your pain level at the time of each blood test. We will take your blood pressure every 30 minutes for the first 2 hours, then every hour for the next two hours, then every 2 hours for the remainder of the infusion. A six hour observation period will take place immediately after the infusion. At this time you will undergo the following: your heart rate and the amount of oxygen in your blood will be monitored continuously with a device that fits over your finger. We will take about 5 teaspoons of blood at the end of the period to try to understand how the study drug affects your body. We will ask you about your pain level at the time of your blood test. We will take your blood pressure every 2 hours for the full duration of the observation period. You may not eat or drink anything that contains caffeine, such as coffee, tea, chocolate or sodas during the infusion and observation periods. We would like to keep track of your medical condition for 30 days after you receive the study drug. We would like to do this by contacting you on the telephone weekly during the 30 days after your participation to see how you are doing.',\n",

       "  \"Each year, during the fall and winter, coinciding with the influenza season, the number of health care visits and the number of days missed from school increases due to febrile respiratory illnesses. The highest rates of influenza infections are present amongst school-age children. The vaccination against seasonal influenza remains the most important measure to prevent infection and to combat the overall spread of the virus. School-age children, in particular, adolescents, may not be aware of the need for influenza vaccination. Interactive computerized educational programs have been developed and used in different pediatric settings in an attempt to increase children's understanding of their medical condition, and improve adherence to the treatment. The investigators identified one of our satellite pediatric clinics, as being the perfect venue for an intervention that will attempt to increase influenza vaccination. The clinic is located in an underserved area. More than 9,000 children are seen annually in this clinic with about 20% of the patients age 8 and above. A pediatric pulmonary office, part of the pediatric clinic, serves a high number of patients, most of whom have poorly controlled asthma. Currently, no focused, developmentally appropriate education programs regarding vaccination are used in our outpatient clinics. The investigators propose implementing an influenza vaccination educational program in this pediatric satellite office that serves a population that has historical low rates of influenza vaccination. The investigators have developed an influenza-vaccination-education-study-program that will involve the use of an animated influenza vaccine-based computer program (videogame) that is designed from the investigator's own initiative. This videogame should provide a basis or foundation to discuss the need for influenza vaccination and the adverse effects of influenza disease. It will be designed to intrigue the child by providing animated tours and creative experiences that are designed to encourage behavioral changes towards the need for vaccination. The investigators hypothesis that by using this hybrid entertainment-educational tool, we will increase children's knowledge about influenza disease and the need for influenza vaccination. By using this age appropriate intervention, we aim to decrease children and adolescent's anxiety related to the vaccination and to increase vaccination rates. The investigators hypothesis that our intervention will have a high impact since it is geared to an ethnic community with historically low rates of influenza vaccination.\",\n",

Ablation, or purposeful destruction of tissue, relieves facet joint pain and pain related to nerve damage by disabling pain-transmitting nerves. Cryoablation for pain management is particularly useful when other modalities are too difficult to perform or have a high incidence for complications or side effects. Currently nerve ablation is performed with bupivacaine and alcohol, but MRI-guided cryoablation of nerves and facets may result in superior efficacy and longer relief. Cryotherapy techniques provide long term analgesia and help alleviate intractable pain for patients with facet joint pain and neuralgia. Minimally invasive Magnetic Resonance (MR)-guided ablation of nerves and facets may lead to decreased procedure time and increased relief of pain due to cancer or nerve degeneration. With the advent of the Advanced Multimodality Image Guided Operating Suite (AMIGO) at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, we have exceptional capabilities for minimally invasive image-guided procedures, including different ablation techniques. The AMIGO suite is equipped with hardware that will keep the patient stationary while the Magnetic Resonance Imaging scanner moves to the patient.

Secondary Aims The secondary aims are to test whether those who receive the intervention compared to standard care have: 3) More appropriate health care utilization (e.g. fewer emergency department visits and admissions to inpatient care); 4) Lower total health care costs; 5) Determine the prevalence of HIV risk behaviors among heroin and pharmaceutical opioid users at risk for overdose and whether the intervention impacts these behaviors.',\n",
       "  'Fatal overdoses involving pharmaceutical opioids have increased dramatically over the past decade, surpassing those related to heroin, and are the leading cause of drug overdose in much of the U.S. In Seattle-King County, 75% of drug overdoses involved pharmaceutical opioids and/or heroin in 2009. Opioid overdoses, heroin and pharmaceutical, are preventable and reversible. Research indicates that drug users and their partners can be successfully trained to recognize and reverse overdoses with naloxone (an opioid antagonist medicine or \"antidote\"). Despite active heroin overdose prevention, education and intervention programs with naloxone (OOPEN) in 15 states with thousands of overdose reversals and no serious adverse events, rigorous studies of these programs on rates of subsequent heroin overdoses have not been conducted. No OOPEN programs or studies have yet been implemented for pharmaceutical opioid users at elevated risk for overdose. The Emergency Department (ED) setting holds great promise for identifying and recruiting those at elevated risk of both heroin and pharmaceutical opioid overdose: 1) the ED study site for this proposal provides most services to those needing care for acute opioid related medical problems in Seattle, and 2) patients\\' need for urgent medical attention may heighten their concern about potential harms from opioids. Unique to this setting is the potential to identify high risk pharmaceutical opioid users, a population that is difficult to locate and engage. ED interventions using brief behavior change counseling (BBCC) have been shown to significantly improve health behaviors such as alcohol use and injury, to increase entry into drug treatment as well as to reduce costs. Evidence is promising, but limited, regarding the impact of BBCC on opioid related risk behaviors. This prospective, randomized ED trial will study the effectiveness of an intervention that combines OOPEN with BBCC for both heroin users (n=500) and pharmaceutical opioid users at elevated risk for overdose (n=500). The primary outcome is subsequent opioid overdoses, ascertained by follow up interviews conducted at 3, 6 and 12 months as well as via administrative records for up to 24 months (i.e. medical records, ambulance responses, and death certificates). Primary Aims The primary aims are to test whether those who receive the intervention compared to standard care have: 1) Lower rates of opioid non-fatal and fatal overdose; 2) Reduce drug use, inappropriate medication use, and other overdose risk behaviors. Secondary Aims The secondary aims are to test whether those who receive the intervention compared to standard care have: 3) More appropriate health care utilization (e.g. fewer emergency department visits and admissions to inpatient care); 4) Lower total health care costs; 5) Determine the prevalence of HIV risk behaviors among heroin and pharmaceutical opioid users at risk for overdose and whether the intervention impacts these behaviors.',\n",

Although many clinicians wait 24 to 48 hours after a positive urine drug screen before administering anesthesia, no standard or practical guidelines have yet to determine when it is safe to proceed with general anesthesia in this patient population. Due to the lack of guidelines for these cases, the rate of cancellation of procedures for these patients is high. The frequent cancelling of such cases causes a waste of resources, personnel, and time. The risks associated with cocaine use that cause most clinicians to cancel cases are mainly due to the cardiovascular effects of cocaine. Increases in blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and the potential for myocardial infarction and fatal arrhythmias are what clinicians fear when administering general anesthesia to these patients. However, due to the urgency of some of the cases, it would be beneficial to both the patient and institutions to know when it is safe to proceed with the case and when it is not.

Each step of the examination with a speculum including insertion, manipulation during examination, and removal can cause discomfort for the patient. Fear of examination pain is considered one barrier to examination compliance. Any method to decrease discomfort during the exam would be considered beneficial to patient screening. Typically two types of speculums are used in clinical practice, metal and plastic. There are advantages to both, and usage is usually predicated by physician preference. Previous studies have demonstrated a clear difference in patient comfort between metal speculums and newer dilating speculums such as the Vera scope (1).

       "  'Sleep-disordered breathing is characterized primarily by partial or total upper airway obstruction during sleep. The most common form of sleep-disordered breathing is obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) due to recurrent collapse of the upper airway with the onset of sleep state. The major risk factors associated with the development of sleep apnea are obesity and male sex. The investigators have also found a high prevalence of OSA in HIV infected men and women, particularly among those with central lipohypertrophy, which is a common finding in HIV-infected persons receiving antiretroviral therapy. Currently, our overall hypothesis is that visceral adiposity, as seen in HIV-infected persons with central lipohypertrophy, alters both mechanical properties and compensatory neuromuscular responses leading to upper airway obstruction. Based on our most recent findings in the non-HIV population, the investigators demonstrate that obesity is associated with elevations in the upper airway load (passive Pcrit) that are counterbalanced by compensatory upper airway neural responses. Moreover, the investigators have found that female sex, peripheral adiposity, and younger age are associated with increased compensatory neuromuscular responses, while male sex, central adiposity, and older age are associated with blunted compensatory responses. The loss of the compensatory neuromuscular responses leads to obstructive sleep apnea. Among HIV-infected patients with central lipohypertrophy, tesamorelin (Egrifta), a growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) analogue, is approved for the reduction of visceral adipose tissue. The investigators hypothesize that tesamorelin therapy will reverse both the mechanical and neurocompensatory alterations associated with increased central obesity. In this project the investigators will determine whether tesamorelin affects sleep apnea severity and compensatory neuromuscular responses of the upper airway on sleep and breathing in men and women with HIV infection. The proposed studies are designed to elucidate the pathophysiologic basis for the development of obstructive sleep apnea in this population. The studies also provide insights into the neurohumoral regulation of upper airway function, and potentially new approaches to the treatment for sleep-disordered breathing.',\n",

A simple randomization is scheduled: in the intervention group a prefascial large-pore low-weight 5 cm wide polypropylene mesh is fixed covering the midline closure; in the control group a conventional closure with a running suture of long-term absorbable material with a suture/wound length ratio 4:1.

       "  'For the treatment of thyroid cancer with the so called targeted therapy the angiogenesis pathway has several potential targets. The Receptors for Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and especially VEGFR-2 is considered to be crucial for the initiation of the formation as well as the maintenance of tumor vasculature. In thyroid cancer these VEGF receptors (VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2), VEGF itself and receptors of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and for the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) are often overexpressed. Other cells as pericytes and smooth muscle cells that are also involved in tumor angiogenesis express these receptors as well. Inhibitors of the VEGFR or PDGFR pathway have been tested in thyroid cancer with positive results. However there is no treatment that is generally considered as standard of care for patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) or medullar thyroid cancer (MTC) who have progressed on one line of therapy. The classical cytotoxic chemotherapy has not shown a clinically meaningful benefit yet. Nintedanib is a triple angiogenesis inhibitor which inhibits receptors of VEGF, FGF and PDGF. Therefore it might act not only on endothelial cells but also on pericytes and smooth muscle cells. Nintedanib also interacts with other kinases such as RET. Because of this multi-kinase activity rationale exists to investigate the effect in MTC and DTC. Because it targets these three major angiogenesis signaling pathways it might prevent further tumor growth and related tumor escape mechanisms. Therefore nintedanib may be active in patients who have progressed on agents that target only one pathway.',\n",

       "  'Oximetry monitoring is common practice in patients undergoing anesthesia. PVI continuous evaluation may be a possibility of agility and ease of obtaining accurate information about the state of cardiovascular responsiveness to volume expansion. This prospective and randomized study will try to demonstrate that the assessment of PVI is a simple and cost-saving method as compared to cardiac output or oxygen delivery monitoring technologies. Such a simple approach has therefore the potential for widespread application as it is not routinely feasible for anesthetists to use cardiac output or oxygen delivery monitoring technologies in many institutions, as well as in many countries.',\n",
       "  'Introduction Several studies have shown that cardiac output optimization improve postoperative outcome and to decrease the cost of surgery [Boyd et al., 1993; Gan et al., 2002; Kern & Shoemaker, 2002 ; Pearse et al., 2005 ; Poeze et al., 2005 ; Sinclair et al., 1997; Wakeling et al., 2005]. Respiratory variations in the arterial pulse pressure and in the pulse oximetry plethysmographic waveform amplitude have been extensively studied in mechanically ventilated patients, and have been demonstrated to be sensitive to changes in ventricular preload as well as reliable predictors of fluid responsiveness in adults [Cannesson et al 2007; Cannesson et al., 2008; Natalini et al., 2006; Solus-Biguenet et al., 2006; Zimmermann et al., 2010]. A few studies have evaluated the impact of a pulse-pressure-variations-guided fluid management on perioperative outcome [Buettner et al., 2008; Fukui et al., 2007; Fukui et al., 2009; Kobayashi et al., 2008; Lopes et al., 2007; Mayer et al, 2009; Oubaha & Poelaert, 2009; Sakamoto et al., 2009]. However, results from these studies are not conclusive and further studies are required to better explore this topic [Cannesson, 2010]. Pulse oximeters are part of the routine monitoring during anesthesia and in the intensive care unit [Dorlas & Nijboer, 1985]. The main interest of the pulse oxymeter is to display arterial oxygenation continuously. Pleth variability index (PVI) is an automatic measure of the dynamic change in perfusion index (PI) that occurs during a complete respiratory cycle. PVI is provided currently by one pulse oximeter manufacturer (Masimo Radical 7 ™, Masimo Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA). The PVI calculation measures changes in PI over a time interval sufficient to include one or more complete respiratory cycles as and is displayed continuously [Cannesson et al., 2008; Zimmermann et al., 2010]. PVI quantifies the variability in plethysmograph waveform due to respiration and is thought to be a surrogate measure of intravascular volume [Cannesson et al., 2008; Zimmermann et al., 2010]. Cannesson et al. reported that a PVI value above 14% predicted fluid responsiveness [Cannesson et al., 2008]. Therefore, the clinical and intra-operative goal of \"maximizing stroke volume by volume loading\" can be achieved by reducing PVI below 14 % [Cannesson et al., 2008; Zimmermann et al., 2010]. Forget et al [2010] demonstrated that PVI based goal-directed fluid management reduced the volume of intraoperative fluid infused and reduced intraoperative and postoperative lactate levels. However, to our knowledge there is no study that evaluate the impact of PVI guided fluid management on perioperative outcome. Materials and Methods Patients This procol has been approved by the local Ethics Committee (Hospital Regional de Presidente Prudente Presidente Prudente, São Paulo, Brazil). The written informed consent will be obtained from each patient. Adults patients underwent high-risk surgery will be selected and randomized to either a control group (group C) or an intervention group (group I). Patients will be selected according to a pre-operative decision (by the surgeon and the intensivist) that post-operative care would be undertaken in the ICU because of co-morbidities or/and the surgical procedure. Patients < 18 years, with cardiac arrhythmias, with a body mass index > 40, and those undergoing surgery with an open thorax, neurosurgery or emergency surgery, will be excluded. Intraoperative monitoring On the day of surgery, they will receive their respective medication in association with anesthetic premedication. Immediately after the arrival in the operating room heart rate, pulse oximetry, blood pressure and capnography will be monitored with a multiparameter bedside monitor (DX 2023, Dixtal™, São Paulo, Brazil). A 20-G catheter line (Smith Medical International™, Lancashire, Uk) will be inserted in the radial artery for continuous arterial pressure measurement and recording. The radial catheter will be connected to a Dixtal® DX 2023 monitor (São Paulo, Brazil). The patients will be anesthetized with loading doses of propofol (2 mg/kg), sufentanil (0,2 - 0,3 µg/kg) and atracurium (0.6 mg/kg). Anesthesia will be maintained by infusion of the same products. After induction of anesthesia, patients underwent tracheal intubation. Artificial ventilation will be provided by a Fabius plus ™ ventilator (Dräger™, Lübeck, Germany) (respiration rate = 12 strokes/min, tidal volume = 8 to 10 ml/kg). Each respiratory cycle will be identified from the capnogram, systolic and diastolic arterial pressures will be measured on a beat-to-beat basis. In patients of intervention group PVI values will be determined over each respiratory cycle (Masimo Radical 7 ™, Masimo Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA). Protocol Randomization will be done pre-operatively using sealed envelopes. During the surgical procedure, patients will be managed according to our institution\\'s standard of care. Group C will receive per-operative fluid at the discretion of the anesthetist, whereas group I will receive additional hydroxyethylstarch 6% (HES) bolus in order to minimize and maintain PVI below 14 %. This PVI cut-off value was chosen according to previous reports [Cannesson et al., 2008; Zimmermann et al., 2010]. During the postoperative period, both groups were managed by intensivists (in the ICU) and clinicians (in the wards) not involved in the intraoperative management or in data collection. These individuals were not informed of patient allocation. Data collection Over the study period all data will be collected prospectively and patients will be followed up until hospital discharge. Pre and intraoperative data collection will be undertaken by one of the investigators, whereas post-operative data collection will be undertaken by another, who was not aware of the allocation group. Before surgery, sex, age, weight, height, history of renal failure requiring dialysis or not, cirrhosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, other cardiac disease, diabetes mellitus, and cerebrovascular disease will be recorded. The body mass index will be calculated according to the standard formula (BMI = weight/height2). Serum creatinine, prothrombin time, hemoglobin, and platelets will be obtained from routine pre-operative biological tests. During the surgical procedure, tidal volume, ventilatory frequency, infused volume of crystalloid solutions, HES, and blood products will be recorded. Heart rate, mean arterial pressure, percutaneous arterial oxygen saturation, and hemoglobin will be collected both at the beginning and the end of the surgical procedure. The duration of surgery will be also recorded. After the surgical procedure, the following parameters will be collected both at ICU admission and 24h later: mean arterial pressure, heart rate, percutaneous arterial oxygen saturation. During the 24h following ICU admission, venous lactate will be measured every 6h and the mean lactate value will be calculated over the first 24h ICU period. The need for continuous vasoactive (dobutamine or/and norepinephrine) support will be recorded. Postoperative ICU infections (pneumonia, abdominal, urinary tract, line related sepsis and wound infections), respiratory complications (pulmonary embolism, acute lung injury, and respiratory support > 24h exclusive of acute lung injury), cardiovascular complications (arrhythmia, hypotension, acute pulmonary edema, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiac arrest exclusive of fatal outcome), abdominal complications (clostridium difficile diarrhoea, acute bowel obstruction, upper gastro-intestinal bleed, and anastomotic leak), hematologic complications (platelet count < 100000/µl or prothrombin time > 1.5 times control), and renal complications (urine output < 500 ml/day or serum creatinine > 170 µmol/L or dialysis for acute renal failure) were collected according to criteria previously used by other investigators [Bennett-Guerrero et al., 1999; Gan et al., 2002; Lopes et al., 2007; Pearse et al., 2005]. Statistical analysis Data will be analyzed comparing patients in group C with those in group I on an intention-to treat basis. The primary outcome measure will be the duration of postoperative hospital stay. On the basis of our own hospital registry, the mean duration of postoperative hospital stay in group C is a priori estimated at 15 ± 7 days (median ± median absolute deviation). According to previous publications we postulated that the mean duration of postoperative hospital stay in group I could be 35% lower [Lopes et al., 2007; Mythen & Webb, 1995; Sinclair et al., 1997]. A sample size of 35 patients in each group was calculated for a 0.05 difference (two sided) with a power of 80% [Schulz & Grimes, 2005]. An intermediate analysis after the enrolment of the first 35 patients was planed, in order to readjust the population sample size if necessary. Secondary outcome measures were the number of post-operative complications per patient, as well as the duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay. Results are expressed as median ± median absolute deviation. The median absolute deviation is a variation of the average absolute deviation that is even less affected by outlying values because these values have less influence on the calculation of the median than they do on the mean. In general, for data with extreme values, the median absolute deviation or interquartile range can provide a more stable estimate or variability than the standard deviation. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare between groups patient characteristics as well as the duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU stay and hospital stay. In group I, the effects of volume expansion with HES administration in PVI will be assessed using a nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum test within each group of patients. A Fisher exact test was performed to compare nominal data. Linear correlations were tested using the Spearman rank method. A p-value lower than a 0.05 chosen level is regarded as statistically significant. All statistical analyses are performed using the StatView TM software for Windows (version 4.57, Abacus Concepts Inc., Berkeley, CA, USA).',\n",

       "  'The manifestation of weakness and involuntary reflexes following motor incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI) may be partly a result of damage to descending pathways to the spinal cord that release serotonin. In models of SCI, for example, application of agents that simulate serotonin has been shown to modulate voluntary motor behaviors, including augmentation of walking recovery. In humans following neurological injury, the effects of 5HT agents are unclear. Few previous reports indicate improved motor function following administration of agents which enhance the available serotonin in the brain, although some data suggests that decreased serotonin may be beneficial. In this application, the investigators propose to study the effects of clinically used agents that increase or decrease intrinsic serotonin activity in the brain on strength and walking ability following human motor incomplete SCI. Using detailed electrophysiological recordings, and biomechanical and behavioral measures, the investigators will determine the effects of acute or chronic doses of these drugs on voluntary and involuntary motor behaviors during static and dynamic conditions. The novelty of this proposed research is the expectation that agents that enhance serotonin activity may increase abnormal reflexes in SCI, but simultaneously facilitate motor and walking recovery. Despite potential improvements in voluntary function, the use of pharmacological agents that may enhance spastic motor behaviors following SCI is in marked contrast to the way in which drugs are typically used in the clinical setting.',\n",
       "  'The proposed study will consist of a double-blinded, randomized controlled trial using a crossover design to assess the effects of SSRIs (escitalopram oxalate, Lexapro®, Forest Pharmaceuticals, Inc) and 5HT-antagonists (cyproheptadine [CYPRO], Periactin ®, Merck, Inc) on volitional and spastic motor behaviors in subjects with motor incomplete SCI following both acute and chronic medication delivery. Voluntary and reflexive motor behaviors in 120 subjects with SCI will be assessed. These interventions will be applied to individuals with acute (< 6 months post injury) chronic (> 1 year post injury) motor incomplete SCI to determine both the rate and extent of changes in volitional motor performance and involuntary spastic behaviors. For the training portion of the study (referred to as subproject 2 below), a portion of the acute and chronic subjects will be evaluated every 2 weeks for up to16 weeks and participate in locomotor training, to investigate and better understand changes in motor function and recovery in individuals with spinal cord injuries. Following 2-4 weeks of this training, individuals will be given either the study drug, or placebo and continue evaluation and training. Following an additional 4 weeks, subjects will be given either the placebo or study drug (whichever they did not receive during the prior 4 weeks). The order will be randomized.',\n",

Thus innovative approaches are needed which combine excellent activity and tolerability in patients with WM, who are mostly of advanced age. The immunochemotherapy DRC (dexamethasone, rituximab, cyclophosphamide) was shown to be highly effective in patients with WM without inducing major hematological toxicities. On the other hand the proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib showed substantial activity as a single agent in WM with only very few side effects when given in a weekly schedule.

These criteria are mainly based on the evolution of serum IgM concentration4. However, delayed IgM monoclonal protein responses may cause important difficulties in response assessment4. In addition, discrepancies between the kinetics of serum M protein reduction and the clearance of monoclonal B-cells from the bone marrow have been reported 5.

Hypothesis: Atopic asthma is characterized by a systemic inflammation and can therefore be the reason for infertility among this group of patients. The aim: The aim of this study is to examine whether female asthmatics and allergic are less fertile then healthy females- whether there is there a link between asthma and infertility. Furthermore if an optimal asthma treatment during fertility treatment reduces time to pregnancy. The design: The project is divided into 3 parts: 1. A Study of Population. In the first part of this project the aim is to evaluate the occurrence of asthmatic and allergic diseases among women with respectively normal fertility and infertility. This is done through data already collected in The Danish twin Study from 1998- 2002 concerning questions about asthma, hay fever, atopic eczema and number of children. 2. A Prospective Study In the second part of this project the aim is to examine clinically, whether female asthmatics in general have more difficulties becoming pregnant then non- asthmatic females. Furthermore we aim to evaluate whether it is allergic or non allergic asthma that affects the fertility the most. 3. Casual study In the third part of this project we only include 40 of the unexplained infertile females collected earlier- 10 females with asthma, 10 females with allergy, 10 females with both asthma and allergy, 10 without any atopic disease.These women have, in addition to the initial asthma and allergy diagnosis, made a suction of the mucus in the uterus, when they are ovulating. This in order to determine whether the environment in the uterus is different in terms of inflammation in atopics. The aim of this study is to find an explanation for a possible decreased pregnancy rate and a longer time to pregnancy in atopics. Material : 396 unexplained infertile females are included, when starting treatment at a fertility clinic. Among these are 197 healthy unexplained infertile females and 197 are females with the combination asthma and unexplained infertility. They are all included due to specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. Methods: All subjects are by inclusion tested for asthma with bronchial provocation tests. The pulmonary function is measured and the severity of their possible asthma is examined by NO in the expired air. Blood samples (RAS test) and prick test are performed to evaluate their possible allergy status. All subjects are to fill out questionnaires concerning asthma, allergy and their infertility. Due to the test mentioned above the subjects are divided in to groups, asthmatic , allergics, atopics and non- atopics. The female asthmatics are treated due to the international guidelines. All groups are followed till achieved pregnancy; where after time to pregnancy can be compared.¨ In the third part of the study a suction of the mucus in the uterus is made at time of ovulation, to determinate the level of inflammation in atopics versus non atopics at time of fertilization.The mucus is examined fore inflammatory markers related to atopy such as TNF alpha, IL4,5,6,8and 33.',\n",

Recent data from our center and others have suggested that low BMD could be observed very early in life. However, quantitative bone abnormalities found out by Dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) need to be confronted to qualitative evaluation of bone microarchitecture (surrogate of bone strength). High-Resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) is a recent technology with very high spatial resolution. Images obtained with this technic are considered as virtual bone biopsies. It enables an accurate bones' cortical and trabecular surfaces exploration in a three-dimensional manner, and therefore provides informations on bone microarchitecture as well as bone density. The aim of this study is to evaluate bone microarchitecture of paediatric patients matched to sex-age-pubertal status-healthy volunteers.

Researchers want to test it in imaging studies for people who are being treated with Birinapant. Birinapant is a drug used to treat advanced ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancers. It works kills tumor cells that have not responded to earlier treatment. 18F-CP18 may help to monitor cancer treatments with this drug. Objectives: - To test the effectiveness of 18F-CP18 imaging studies during cancer treatment with Birinapant. Eligibility: - Individuals at least 18 years of age who are taking Birinapant for ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer. Design: - Participants will have a brief physical exam. They will also answer questions about their medical history and any current medications. - Participants will receive a dose of 18F-CP18, followed by an imaging study. The study will involve a positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan. The scan will last 40 minutes. - There will be two more PET/CT scans 1 hour and 2 hours after taking 18F-CP18.

       "  'Background: Dysregulation of apoptosis is instrumental in forming the malignant phenotype and is associated with resistance to chemotherapeutics and biological therapies. Cleaved Caspase 3 (its activated form) plays a key role in the common apoptotic pathway. CP18 is an enzyme substrate of caspase 3. The formulation [18F]-CP18 includes PEG vector which facilitates internalization and can be non-invasively imaged using PET. Once cleaved into polar fragments by caspase 3, it become trapped within the cells.

       "  \"Vitiligo is a chronic acquired disease characterized by well defined white macules and patches affecting the skin and mucous membranes. Mucocutaneous lesions develop secondary to selective destruction of melanocytes. It has a major psychosocial impact on affected patients. The etiology of vitiligo is largely unknown but more likely to be multifactorial. There are several theories on the pathogenesis of vitiligo including mainly the autoimmune, neurohormonal, and autocytotoxic theories. The autoimmune hypothesis has the strongest evidence with alteration mainly in the cellular immune response. Diagnosis of vitiligo is usually made clinically. A skin biopsy is rarely needed for diagnosis and typically shows absence of melanin in the epidermis with no or few melanocytes. Perivascular inflammation has been found in approximately 92% of cases. Spontaneous repigmentation is uncommon (seen in 10-20% of patients) in vitiliginous patches but can occur. Repigmentation occurs usually in a perifollicular pattern, suggesting that the hair follicle functions as a reservoir for melanocytes. There are many treatment modalities available for vitiligo, however, none of them cure the disease. These include different topical treatments, phototherapy, surgical therapy, and depigmentation therapy. Topical corticosteroids (CS) are commonly used as a first-line therapy for localized vitiligo. They are the most effective monotherapy for localized vitiligo. Studies have shown an increase in inflammatory cells in vitiliginous skin, mainly macrophages and T cells. Efficacy of CS in vitiligo is attributed to modulation of the immune response, reduction of destruction of melanocytes, and induction of melanocyte proliferation and melanin production. Treatment with intralesional corticosteroids (ILCS) is commonly used in many dermatologic conditions. There are only a few studies published on the use of ILCS in vitiligo. Triamcinolone acetonide (TA) is the most commonly used form of ILCSs. It is characterized by low solubility, being slowly absorbed from the injection site, prompting maximal local action, limiting diffusion and spread through tissue, and not giving rise to systemic side effects if used in therapeutic doses. The concentration that is most commonly used in dermatology is 2.5 mg/ml. Side effects of intralesional TA (IL TA) include pain at the injection site, mild bleeding, transient atrophy and telangiectasia, hypopigmentation, and hyperpigmentation. Infection is uncommon but caution over bony prominences is recommended. It has been shown that TA at a total dose of 20 mg does not result in adrenal suppression. Hypersensitivity reactions to TA or the vehicle carboxymethylcellulose are extremely rare. The investigators' hypothesis is that IL TA will induce significant skin pigmentation to improve vitiligo. This due to the anti-inflammatory effect of IL TA. IL TA has been successfully used in the treatment of many skin conditions with an autoimmune pathogenesis including alopecia areata. The investigators plan on conducting a prospective double-blind randomized clinical trial to assess efficacy and safety of IL TA in the treatment of vitiligo. Study Objectives 1. To evaluate the potential for IL TA to induce repigmentation within vitiligo patches. 2. To assess the side effect profile of IL TA when used in the treatment of vitiligo.\",\n",

Obese Thai children are probable risk for folate deficiency due to low dietary folate intake and low serum folate level from unbalanced diet (low vegetables intake & high fat diet) and high prevalence of thalassemia. Moreover obese children are also at risk of atherosclerosis. However, no data have been reported about effect of folic acid supplementation on homocysteine level in these patients.',\n",

       "  'Epiphora, or uncontrolled tearing of the eyes, represents a common presenting complaint of patients seen by ophthalmologists. Epiphora may be due to non-obstructive causes, such as tear hypersecretion or functional tear pump failure, or obstructive causes. Functional tear pump failure may result from malposition of the eyelids, such as an abnormal out-turning (ectropion) or in-turning (entropion) of the eyelid. Currently methods to diagnose partial nasolacrimal duct obstruction are purely qualitative in nature. Our research goal is to quantitatively measure the pressure generated during conventional probing and irrigation (P&I), and to measure the resistance to irrigation of the nasolacrimal drainage system. The investigators will measure the pressure generated during conventional P&I using a disposable in-line pressure transducer. In addition, the investigators will use a syringe pump to deliver a constant flow rate of saline through a nasolacrimal cannula and measure the steady state irrigation pressure using the in-line transducer and digital pressure monitor. Resistance can be directly calculated from the known flow rate and pressure measurements. The investigators will compare both the pressure generated during P&I and the lacrimal drainage resistance between patients with lacrimal drainage obstruction and controls patients with no obstruction (functional tear pump failure) as determined by clinical exam.

       "  \"Lacrimal Drainage Resistance I. Introduction This proposal describes our plan to study the resistance of the lacrimal drainage system during irrigation. II. Research Aims A. Specific Aims 1. To quantitatively measure the resistance of the lacrimal drainage system during irrigation. 2. To determine differences in lacrimal drainage resistance between patients with obstructed tear drainage systems and patients with functional tear pump failure. 3. To measure the pressure generated during traditional probing and irrigation of the lacrimal drainage system. B. Background and Significance Epiphora, or uncontrolled tearing of the eyes, represents a common presenting complaint of patients seen by ophthalmologists. Epiphora may be due to non-obstructive causes, such as tear hypersecretion or functional tear pump failure, or obstructive causes. Functional tear pump failure may result from malposition of the eyelids, such as an abnormal out-turning (ectropion) or in-turning (entropion) of the eyelid. Tears normally drain from the eye through two small holes, called puncta, one located in the upper eyelid and one in the lower eyelid, and then through two channels, called canaliculi, that empty into the lacrimal sac. Tears drain from the lacrimal sac through the bony nasolacrimal duct into the nasal cavity. Obstruction may occur at any level of the system, and may be partial or complete.[1] The focus of this study is acquired (as opposed to congenital), nasolacrimal duct obstruction. The normal work-up for evaluation of nasolacrimal duct obstruction includes multiple clinical tests to evaluate the patency of the drainage system, including the fluorescein dye disappearance test, primary and secondary Jones dye tests, and canalicular probing and irrigation (P&I). While complete obstruction is relatively easily determined, partial obstruction is more difficult. Each of the available tests is qualitative in nature and is unable to determine the degree of partial obstruction. [1, 2] Current management options for the treatment of partial nasolacrimal duct obstruction include repeated canalicular probing and irrigation, balloon catheter dilation with placement of silicone stents, and dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) surgery. Repeated probing and irrigation may be performed in the clinic without anesthesia, but has a low rate of improved symptoms. Balloon catheter dilation with stent placement is typically performed under general anesthesia, requires no incisions, and has a success rate between 60-73%.[3, 4]. DCR surgery, also typically performed under general anesthesia, surgically bypasses the nasolacrimal duct by removing a window of bone and anastomosing the lacrimal sac to the nasal cavity. The success rate of DCR is over 95%.[1, 5] There are two previously published methods to measure lacrimal drainage resistance. In 1991, Stanley and Masri described a device to measure resistance with a hand-held instrument connected to a personal computer.[6] They reported values from 13 normal controls, but did not test the device in patients with tearing. In 1995, Tucker et al. reported a laboratory-based device that measured the resistance to fluid flow in the lacrimal drainage system.[2] They measured resistance in healthy controls, in patients after successful DCR, and in one tearing patient. The investigators will measure the pressure generated during conventional P&I using a disposable in-line pressure transducer. In addition, the investigators will use a syringe pump to deliver a constant flow rate of saline through a nasolacrimal cannula and measure the steady state irrigation pressure using the in-line transducer and digital pressure monitor. Resistance can be directly calculated from the known flow rate and pressure measurements. Clinical applications for measuring lacrimal drainage resistance include quantifying partial nasolacrimal duct obstruction, guiding the choice of surgical procedure, and determining the success of lacrimal drainage procedures. III. Study Design and Methods Study Design: The investigators plan to measure lacrimal drainage resistance in consented patients undergoing evaluation and management of epiphora who require traditional probing and irrigation. In addition to the traditional probing and irrigation of the nasolacrimal system, the investigators will measure the lacrimal drainage resistance using our study equipment. Accrual Goals and Recruitment Period: The accrual goal for this study is 40 eligible patients. The final clinical diagnosis of lacrimal drainage obstruction versus functional tear pump failure will be based upon the investigators clinical findings and standard probing and irrigation results. Patient Entry: Patient eligibility will be determined by the study's principal investigator or co-investigators and as described in this protocol. The investigator will interview eligible patients and explain in detail the purpose of the study. Those patients who agree to participate will have the pressure measured during conventional P&I and lacrimal drainage resistance measured in addition to the normal clinical work-up. For those patients who agree to participate in the study, signing the informed consent constitutes study entry. Time Requirement: The investigators estimate that it will take 2 months for patient accrual and measurements. Follow-Up: There are no required follow-up visits. Measurement of outcomes: Two measurements will be obtained from each patient. First, the investigators will record the pressure generated during traditional probing and irrigation using a disposable in-line pressure transducer. Second, the investigators will measure the pressure generated using a syringe pump to deliver a constant flow rate. The investigators will then directly calculate the resistance to irrigation from the pressure and flow rate. IV. Study Procedure: The Intervention Probing and irrigation (P&I) of the lacrimal drainage system is a standard component of the evaluation of tearing patients. During this procedure, a nasolacrimal cannula is inserted into the canaliculus and saline solution is irrigated through the system. The investigators will measure the pressure generated during P&I using a disposable in-line pressure transducer. In addition to conventional P&I, consented patients would undergo a second irrigation procedure using our measuring equipment. In order to eliminate any bias due to the order of testing, half of the patients will undergo conventional P&I first, and half will undergo the experimental P&I first. During the experimental P&I, a syringe pump will deliver a constant flow rate of saline through a nasolacrimal cannula. The investigators will measure the steady state irrigation pressure using an in-line transducer and digital pressure monitor. Resistance will be calculated from the known flow rate and pressure measurements. The investigators will obtain three measurements from each patient. The syringe pump is designed to prevent backflow of saline, and in addition the disposable portion of the pressure transducer exposed to the saline will be changed between each patient. The syringe pump has an automatic safety cut-off if the line is occluded. V. Interpretation of Data The investigators will record the pressure generated during conventional P&I and the average pressure generated during steady-state irrigation. Resistance will be directly calculated from the average pressure measurement. The investigators will compare both the pressure generated during P&I and the lacrimal drainage resistance between patients with lacrimal drainage obstruction and controls patients with no obstruction (functional tear pump failure) as determined by clinical exam. The investigators will summarize data in terms of means and standard deviations. The null hypothesis, that there are no differences between groups, will be tested by a two-sample Students t-test with p < .05 for rejection of the null. For lacrimal drainage resistance, a sample size of 17 patients per group gives a power of 0.91 to detect a difference as small as 20 mmHg*sec/ml. The power measurements are based upon the work of Tucker et al., who measured an average resistance of 49.5 +/- 17.0 mmHg*sec/ml in normal controls, and a single measurement of 212 mmHg*sec/ml in a patient with symptomatic tearing.[2] Technical complications will be noted and described. All patient information will be a part of the permanent medical record and will be no different from the information documented in standard nasolacrimal irrigation. VI. Consent Procedure In addition to a verbal discussion describing the study, including the risks and benefits, the investigators will provide patients undergoing evaluation for epiphora including conventional probing and irrigation with a formal consent form, and the investigators will provide a copy of this consent for personal reference. The proposed consent form is attached. VII. Adverse Events The anticipated adverse events of conventional probing and irrigation are anxiety and discomfort during the procedure, foreign body sensation for 12-24 hours following the procedure, and irrigant or dye on clothing. Anticipated serious adverse events of conventional probing and irrigation include dacryocystitis and damage to the lacrimal drainage system including punctal rupture. The incremental risks of the experimental probing and irrigation relate to the pump device. Because the pump device has an automatic safety cut-off and pushes fluid at a very low flow rate (0.09 mL/s) the investigators believe that the incremental risks are very low. Stanley and Masri reported one case of punctal rupture using their experimental setup.[6] The investigators believe this is unlikely to occur in our experiment because the investigators are using a standard nasolacrimal cannula to irrigate, and the investigators are using a much lower flow rate (0.09 mL/s versus 0.25 mL/s). All adverse events will be documented in the data collection forms and brought to the attention of the patient and his or her family as soon as possible after their occurrence. Patients are provided with contact information for the principle investigator as well as the Institutional Review Board in the consent form, and an on-call ophthalmologist is always available for emergent care after hours. On-call ophthalmologists will have direct pager access to the investigators and will notify them immediately of any adverse events encountered in study patients. Serious and unanticipated adverse events will be promptly reported to the Institutional Review Board by the principle investigator. VII. Cited Literature 1. Mills, D.M. and D.R.

       "  'Adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) for gastric cancer is known to improve prognosis, and longer time to AC is associated with worse survival. However, most clinical trials mandate that AC is still to commence within 6 to 8 weeks after surgery consideration for malnutrition, postoperative complications and intolerance of AC. Placement of jejunostomy nutrition tube for enteral nutrition is a common component of these procedures, as a result of superior postoperative organ function, decreased infection rates, and a greater likelihood to complete AC with enteral nutritional support. Fast-track surgery (FTS) recovery program focuses on enhancing recovery and reducing morbidity. Introduction of FTS concepts are safe, feasible, and can achieve shorter hospital stays and reduced costs. Early postoperative enteral nutrition combined with FTS results in reductions in total complications compared with traditional postoperative feeding practices and does not negatively affect outcomes. However, the benefit of jejunostomy nutrition tube routine placement and combination with FTS is still being debated. Besides, there remains some controversy over the optimal combination of nutrients and duration and timing and routes of feed administration. The aim of this study was to determine whether FTS with early jejunostomy nutrition (EJN) following laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric cancer improved postoperative recovery and minimizes time to AC when compared with FTS with early oral nutrition (EON).',\n",

       "  'Current standard of care for early stage breast cancer is mastectomy or breast conserving therapy with whole breast irradiation following lumpectomy. However, studies of breast cancer recurrence have demonstrated the majority of tumors to recur in or adjacent to the original tumor site. The question has thus been raised as to whether radiation to the whole breast is necessary or justified. Limiting radiation to the area of the original tumor may reduce acute and long-term skin and organ toxicities while making radiation therapy more convenient and less expensive. Several clinical trials are underway comparing partial breast irradiation (PBI) to whole breast irradiation. Numerous centers are offering partial breast irradiation outside of clinical trials as well, despite the lack of long-term safety and efficacy data on PBI. Available PBI methods include brachytherapy, in which catheters or balloons are surgically inserted to deliver radiation therapy to the lumpectomy cavity, and conventional external beam radiation therapy, or EBRT. External beam photon therapy is attractive for its non-invasive nature and ability to deliver a more homogenous dose distribution compared to brachytherapy, however it also delivers a greater radiation dose to surrounding normal breast tissue.Proton therapy has the capacity to provide the same advantages as photon EBRT while minimizing dose to normal surrounding tissue. Clinical data on PBI with protons is minimal, however, leaving many questions unanswered. The impetus behind this protocol is to address these gaps by further investigating the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of proton therapy for partial breast irradiation.',\n",

       "  'Preeclampsia is a pregnancy-specific, multisystem disorder that complicates approximately 5 % of pregnancies. Tracheal intubation in the women with severe pre-eclampsia is usually associated with exaggerated transient increases in blood pressure, heart rate and maternal plasma catecholamine concentrations. These changes may lead to maternal cerebral oedema, haemorrhage, left ventricular failure, pulmonary oedema or mortality, and reduce uterine blood flow which may adversely affect the neonatal wellbeing. Therefore, the attenuation of the haemodynamic responses to tracheal intubation in this unique group of patients is demanding for the best of both mother and foetus. The use of single remifentanil boluses of 0.5 to 1 µg/kg reduces effectively the haemodynamic and catecholamine responses to laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation in severe pre-eclamptics during Cesarean delivery under general anesthesia. Unfortunately, the use of 1 µg/kg doses are associated with more maternal hypotension and neonatal respiratory depression requiring resuscitation. Moreover, the use of preinduction remifentanil bolus of 0.5 µg/kg followed by a continuous infusion at 0.15-0.2 µg/kg/min is associated with significant attenuation of the maternal stress response to tracheal intubation with variable degree of neonatal depression in non-pre-eclamptic women. Whereas, the use of infusion rates of 0.1 µg/kg/min or less is less likely to produce neonatal depression. In our previous study, we demonstrated that the preoperative administration of dexmedetomidine 0.4 and 0.6 µg/kg/h, a specific alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist, blunts the maternal haemodynamic and hormonal responses to Caesarean delivery under sevoflurane anaesthesia without adverse neonatal effects. However the use of 0.6 µg/kg/h doses is associated with higher postoperative sedation scores.',\n",
       "  \"We hypothesize that the preoperative intravenous dexmedetomidine (0.4 µg/kg/h) and remifentanil (0.1 µg/kg/min) infusions will have comparable maternal haemodynamic responses to tracheal intubation, surgical stimulation and extubation after uncomplicated Caesarean delivery under general anesthesia in parturients with severe pre-eclampsia, without adverse neonatal effects. Anaesthetic management will be standardized in all studied patients. Oral ranitidine 150 mg and metoclopramide 10 mg will be given the night before and on the morning of surgery, with 0.3 mol/L sodium citrate 30 mL given 15 min before induction. Magnesium sulphate will be given as a loading dose of 4 g intravenously, followed by i.v. infusion of 1g/hour for seizures prophylaxis. Intravenous boluses of hydralazine 5 mg at 20-min intervals will be used if SAP increases above 160 mm Hg or DAP above 110 mm Hg, to keep the diastolic blood pressure at approximately 90 mmHg and the doses used will be recorded. The studied population will be allocated randomly to one of two groups, (n = 18, in each), by drawing sequentially numbered sealed opaque envelopes containing a software-generated randomization code (Random Allocation Software, version 1.0.0, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran), to receive either dexmedetomidine (0.4 µg/kg/h) or remifentanil (0.1 µg/kg/min) starting 20 and 5 min before induction of anaesthesia, respectively, and will be discontinued after peritoneal closure. The dexmedetomidine and remifentanil solutions looked identical. One anaesthesiologist who is not otherwise involved in the study, will prepare the study solutions, install them in the infusion pumps, set up the dose according to the assigned randomized dose, and will mask the infusion pumps with an opaque sheet throughout the procedure to ensure the blindness of the assessors. Another anaesthesiologist who will be blinded to treatment regimen provided perioperative care. A third anaesthesiologist will collect perioperative data. All staff in the operating room will be unaware of patient allocation. Maternal monitoring will include three lead-electrocardiography, non-invasive blood pressure, and pulse oximetry. Left uterine displacement will be maintained. After preoxygenation for 3 min, rapid sequence induction will be performed using propofol 1.5-2.5 mg/kg and suxamethonium 1 mg/kg with the application of cricoid pressure from the time of loss of the consciousness until the inflation of the cuff of the endotracheal tube. Laryngoscopy will be performed after the 1-min blood pressure recording, and tracheal intubation will be completed before the 2-min reading. Correct placement of the endotracheal tube will be confirmed with direct visualization of the passage of its tip between the vocal cords, auscultation of equal breath sounds on both sides of the chest and capnography waveform. The patient's lungs will be mechanically ventilated to maintain (ETCO2) at 30-35mmHg. Anaesthesia will be maintained with a 0.5-0.7% minimum alveolar concentration of sevoflurane in oxygen. Atracurium 0.5 mg/kg will be given for muscle relaxation to maintain suppression of the second twitch using a train-of-four stimulation. The Induction-to-delivery time will be recorded using a stopwatch. After the umbilical cord is clamped, a 5-10 IU infusion of oxytocin in 500 mL of lactated Ringer's solution will be started and morphine 0.1 mg/kg will be given. After peritoneal closure, study solution will be discontinued.At the end of surgery, sevoflurane will be discontinued, residual neuromuscular block will be antagonized and the trachea will be extubated. Postoperative analgesia will be achieved according to the authors' hospital protocol with 12-hourly IM diclofenac (75 mg), 6-hourly IVI paracetamol (1 g), and rescue doses of IV meperidine (25 mg). Statistical analysis: Data will be tested for normality using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. X2 test will be used for categorical data. Repeated-measures analysis of variance will be done to test the serial changes in hemodynamic and cortisol data. Student-t- and Mann Whitney U tests will be used to compare the parametric and nonparametric data between the two studied groups. Data will be expressed as mean (SD), number (%), or median [range]. p < 0.05 will be considered to represent statistical significance. In a previous study, Yoo et al have demonstrated that the mean (SD) values of MAP at 1 min after tracheal intubation in those received remifentanil bolus were 118 (20) mm Hg. A priori power analysis revealed that 16 patients would be needed in each group to detect a 20% difference in MAP values, 1 min after intubation, after the administration of remifentanil with a type I error of 0.05 and a power of 90%. We assumed that the detection of 20% differences in the mean MAP would be of clinically importance. We increased the sample size by 10% to compensate for patients dropping out during the study.\",\n",

Methods: Data from patients with AOG were analysed from a prospectively collected database with regard to surgical treatment, preoperative and postoperative staging, and outcome.',\n",
       "  \"A prospective database of all patients with surgically resectable esophageal, cardia and gastric carcinomas was established in 1992 at the Department for General, Visceral and Thoracic Surgery at the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany. Only patients without neoadjuvant therapy and histologically proven AEG type I and II were included into this study. The demographic, clinical, operative and postoperative courses of each patient were collected. Informed consent was obtained from all patients before including them in the prospective database which was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of the chamber of physicians of Hamburg. Preoperative examinations of patients included physical examination, routine blood tests, plain chest radiography, abdominal ultrasonography, endoscopy, endosonography (EUS), computed tomography (CT) of the chest and abdomen as well as positron emission tomography (PET)-CT after January 2006 and studies of tumor markers (CEA, CA 19-9), in selected patients. Tumour localization was defined according the Siewert classification (3) based upon endoscopy, endosonography and intraoperative assessment of the respective surgeon. All patients undergoing a thoracoabdominal esophagectomy (TA) were operated with a right-sided thoracotomy, and a median inverse T-shaped laparotomy. Peritumoral resection included an en bloc subtotal esophageal resection with dissection of the right-sided paratracheal, aortopulmonary window, subcarinal and mediastinal lymph nodes (LN) and the azygos vein and a collar or high intrathoracically anastomosis. An extensive lymphadenectomy of the upper abdominal compartment (D-II lymphadenectomy, including the paracardial, the left gastric artery nodes along with the LN of the lesser and greater curvature of the stomach, the prepyloric LN, the celiac trunk, the common hepatic artery, the LN in the hepathoduodenal ligament and the LN at the splenic artery) was conducted. The transhiatal esophagectomy (TH) consisted of an inversed T-shaped laparotomy, a wide peritumoral dissection of the distal esophagus, DII lymphadenectomy and a dissection of the LN of the posterior mediastinum extending as far as the carina of the trachea. Extended gastrectomy (EG) consisted of an inversed T-shaped laparotomy, a gastrectomy with resection of the distal esophagus, D-II lymphadenectomy plus dissection of the lower posterior mediastinum LN. The reconstruction included a jejunal loop with a J-pouch. Histopathological analyses were performed by a senior specialist in gastrointestinal pathology. All removed LN were counted, identified according to their location and assessed separately. Standard histopathologic analysis of paraffin-embedded LN was performed by serial sections of 5 µm thickness and staining with hematoxylin-eosin and van Gieson. The histopathological report including tumour type, stage and grade was determined according to the 7th edition of the TNM classification (8, 12). The percentage of positive lymph nodes in regard to excised lymph nodes was classified according the definition of Bogoevski et al. (13). Postoperative follow-up was conducted at three months intervals for the first two years and at six-month intervals thereafter, and included physical examination, plain chest radiography, abdominal ultrasonography, endoscopy, endosonography, computed tomography of the chest and abdomen as well as PET-CT after January 2006 in selected patients. Further, studies of tumor markers (carcinoembryonic antigen and CA 19-9), and bone scanning were performed. Recurrence was diagnosed if proven by biopsy or unequivocal evidence of tumour masses with a tendency to grow during further follow-up and/or follow-up until death. Events considered were death, local recurrence, and distant metastasis. When no events were recorded, the patients were censored for the statistical evaluation at the last contact. Overall survival, defined as time from operation to death or last follow-up, and local recurrence-free survival, defined as time from operation to time of diagnosis of local tumour recurrence, were calculated. Statistical analysis SPSS 17.0 for Windows was used for statistical analysis. Associations between categorical variables were assessed by χ2 test. The Mann-Whithney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used for analysis of continuous variables. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyse recurrence and death. Differences between patient groups were assessed using log-rank tests. Apart from patient's sex and age at surgery, those co-variates with a p-value <0.05 in univariable survival analysis (log rank test) were entered into multivariable Cox proportional-hazards analysis to assess the independent influence of these co-variates and shown as hazard ratio (HR) and 95 per cent c.i.. Because this analysis was intended to be explorative, no adjustment for multiple testing was carried out. Differences were considered to be statistically significant at P<0.05.\",\n",

However, if IOP remains uncontrolled and/or the optic nerve damage progresses despite controlled IOP, surgery may be indicated. Deep sclerectomy (DS) is a non-penetrating surgical procedure for the treatment of open angle glaucoma that allows the enhancement of the aqueous outflow by removing part of the inner wall of Schlemm's canal and trabecular meshwork.

The duration of study will be 14-23 weeks for each patient. The patients switch to study drugs after all assessments have been done at visit 1. The strength of the levodopa in the study drug is determined by the patient's individually optimised levodopa regimen before randomisation. During the first 2 weeks of each treatment period, the patient's levodopa strength (but not frequency) in the study drug will be adjusted as necessary by the investigator. For the remaining 2 weeks of each treatment period, the levodopa strengths should be kept stable. Unscheduled visits maybe performed during the first 2 weeks of each treatment period, if there is a need to adjust the levodopa strength. In case the patient has not contacted the study centre within a week after the start of the treatment period, the study personnel will phone the patient to ensure that the symptoms and possible adverse events (AEs) are sufficiently controlled and captured, and to assess the need to adjust the levodopa treatment.\",\n",

The study was approved by an Ethics Committee and support by the Canadian Thoracic Society through an unrestrictive grant from GlaxoSmithKline.

       "  'Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are the two most common chronic pulmonary ailments in Canada, affecting about 2.5 million and 750 thousand individuals, respectively. In the last two decades, the Canadian Thoracic Society (CTS) has successfully developed and disseminated evidence-based asthma and COPD clinical practice guidelines. However, evidence suggests that guideline implementation in these diseases remains inadequate. Successful guideline implementation requires tailoring of selected strategies to settings and population-specific barriers, based on established theories and principles. In 2004, the CTS and its collaborators organized a symposium in Quebec City, to discuss existing barriers to respiratory guideline implementation and possible knowledge translation (KT) strategies. This was followed in the fall of 2007 by an expert-led workshop on guideline implementation strategies. Herein, the investigators report the planned methods and outcome of a project which resulted from these meetings. This study sought to explore the effectiveness of a multi-faceted KT strategy in improving concordance with COPD and asthma guidelines among primary care physicians (PCPs) in Canada, but was aborted due to inadequate PCP recruitment. The investigators discuss the difficulties encountered in recruiting PCPs, factors which may have influenced recruitment, and alternative strategies. The goal of the investigators is to provide practical lessons to inform the design of future KT initiatives with similar interventions and/or a similar target audience.',\n",

       "  'Changes in Inflammatory Cytokine Levels in Response to Spinal Manipulative Treatment of Low Back Patients: A Single-blind Pilot Clinical Trial.',\n",
       "  'It is expected that mechanical low back pain (LBP) is associated with inflammatory changes localized to the affected tissues. Could such changes be detected in cells involved in the inflammatory process in an in vitro model? The investigators wish to test such a model to compare inflammatory markers in acute and chronic LBP patients and also examine the effect of spinal manipulative treatment (SMT) on changing the level of selected key inflammatory markers. The investigators hypothesize that: 1. Proinflammatory markers will be elevated while antinflammatory markers will be reduced in acute LBP patients relative to chronic back pain patients as well as in healthy study participants who have no LBP or any inflammatory conditions (controls). 2. SMT will cause a reduction in the production of proinflammatory markers while anti-inflammatory markers will increase relative to baseline levels as well as relative to controls',\n",
       "  \"Background: Spinal manipulative treatment(SMT) may work by reducing mechanical irritation to joint tissues (1) and thereby diminishing local inflammation. Evidence for an anti-inflammatory effect of instrument-assisted SMT has been observed in an animal model (2). These findings are consistent with the recently proposed hypothesis that the origin of all pain may be associated with inflammation and augmented production of inflammatory mediators (cytokines), principally TNFα (3). TNFα plays a major role in the pathophysiology of neuropathic pain-associated inflammation (4) and has been implicated in spinal pain syndromes, including intervertebral disc-related low back pain (5, 6) and sciatica (7,8). Our recent studies demonstrated that production of inflammatory mediators is elevated in patients with chronic cervical spine pain, both in vitro and in vivo, and accompanied by up-regulation of chemokine (CC) synthesis (9). Recent reports on clinical (10), animal (2) and human in vitro models (11) suggest that SMT may exert an anti-inflammatory effect. Thus, Song et al. (2) found that SMT reduced inflammatory neuropathic pain. Teodorczyk-Injeyan et al. (11) demonstrated a significant attenuation of pro-inflammatory cytokine production in vitro, and no changes in serum substance P (SP) levels following SMT. Other studies from our laboratory showed that SMT may enhance both the production of and the response to the immunomodulatory cytokine, IL-2, and IL-2-dependent antibody synthesis (12, 13). Reduction in serum TNFα levels has been reported for cervicogenic headache patients (n=2, case studies) (14, 15). These observations suggest that SMT effects may be transduced into cellular components of the immune system. Thus far, the clinical relevance of the effect of SMT as a modulator of inflammatory mediator production is unknown. Despite evidence of inflammatory pathophysiology of spinal pain (16), including a subtype of non-specific spinal pain (17), only one clinical study (18) evaluated the correlation between serum TNFα levels, pain intensity and back function. In this proposed study we intend to use a clinical model to investigate the baseline levels of proinflammatory cytokines in acute and chronic low back pain patients and explore the potential anti-inflammatory effect of SMT following a course of manipulative treatments. Thus, Aim 1 is to determine baseline pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in individuals experiencing acute or chronic lower spinal pain of mechanical etiology, and compare them with asymptomatic controls'. Aim 2 is to explore the relationships between SMT, pain level and functional impairment, and the production of inflammatory mediators relative to baseline. Anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10 and IL-1ra) have been found to be produced alongside, and in parallel, with their respective pro-inflammatory counterparts (TNFα and IL-1β), and act in concert to sustain/restore homeostasis (19). The proposed study will include determinations, in addition to pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-1, TNFα, IL-6) levels, of the levels of IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) and IL-10. Assessment of IL-10 synthesis is particularly relevant as this cytokine up-regulates the production of IL-1ra, which competes with active IL-1 for binding to IL-1 receptors, and which acts as a potent natural anti-inflammatory protein (19, 20). Study design; Subject Recruitment: Subjects (volunteers) of both sexes, between the ages 20 and 60 years, experiencing acute (less than 4 weeks in duration) or chronic (12 weeks or longer in duration) mechanical low back pain (experienced between spinal levels L1- L5, with or without sacroiliac [SI] joint involvement) will be recruited by Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College (CMCC) personnel and posters from CMCC's outpatient clinics, and from the general public through newspaper advertisements . CMCC is in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), where the population is a diverse ethnic mix (21). Potential participants who have presented to one of the CMCC clinics for the purpose of treatment will be encouraged/recruited by interns/clinicians prior to commencement of treatments. Others who present to participate in the research study will first be assigned to one of the clinic pods for initial assessment prior to entering the study. In no case, however, will participants have received SMT 4 weeks prior to commencement of the study. Candidates will be interviewed in order to determine eligibility (see exclusion criteria, Appendix 1). They will complete the research intake form (Appendix 2) and be given detailed explanations about the research protocol (Appendix 3). A cohort of matching healthy asymptomatic subjects, recruited from the general population, will serve as controls for the determination of baseline cytokine levels. Sample size determination: Data published for TNFα levels in chronic neck pain patients versus asymptomatic controls (9) were used to calculate a sample size estimate for this study. The study is powered for the primary outcome measure related to Question 1, looking at the difference between symptomatic and asymptomatic low back pain subjects at baseline (see Statistical Analyses). From Cohen's table (22), based on a power of 0.8, a two-tailed test with a p value < 0.05, the sample size was estimated to be 17 per group. In order to account for drop-outs and errors that may arise in the blood cultures, the sample size will be increased to 20 per group. As a result, there will be 40 symptomatic subjects and 20 asymptomatic controls, which should provide a more than adequate sample to test the primary outcome. Subject assessment and group assignment: Qualified subjects will be scheduled. They will be greeted by one of two investigators (depending on recruitment site) , who will brief them and review the intake/eligibility form (Appendix 3) to confirm their eligibility before asking them to sign the informed consent form (Appendix 4). All subjects will then be asked to indicate their pain intensity level on the 10-point visual analogue scale (VAS) and complete the Oswestry functional disability questionnaire. They will then be assessed with standard chiropractic, orthopaedic and neurological tests by their respective chiropractic interns and supervising clinicians, who will assign them to the acute or chronic LBP groups, and who will formulate and explain a treatment plan.. For the duration of the study, treatments will consist of manual SMT and, where needed, manual (not instrument-assisted) soft tissue work provided by the clinician. Other treatment modalities will not be used. Patients will receive 6 treatments over the course of 2 weeks. (comprised of manipulation of one lumbar or sacroiliac articulation, with or without soft tissue therapy). SMT will consist of a single high velocity, low amplitude (HVLA) thrust intended to cavitate and restore mobility to the joint. If at initial presentation a manipulative segment could not be identified, the patient will be excluded from the study. If on the other hand a manipulable segment is not found at subsequent visits, the clinician will limit the treatment to palpation and some soft tissue work as indicated . In all cases a blood sample will be drawn (see below) after initial assessment and prior to commencement of treatments of patients, in order to establish a baseline level of cytokines for each participant (primary outcome). At their 7th visit (at least 2 days after last treatment), a blood sample will be taken prior to commencement of any further treatment, and they will be asked to complete the exit questionnaire including a VAS (Appendix 5). Should a patient recover following a few treatments, as assessed by subjective feedback from the patient and a VAS result of less than 3/10, then a blood sample will be taken earlier and such will be duly noted. Should a patient require continued treatments beyond the 6 stipulated by the study, s/he will be free to do so under the direction of the clinician in charge of their case. Interventions: Manipulation: As noted above, each spinal manipulation will consist of a HVLA thrust to an affected segment (23). A clinician will deliver treatments according to his/her assessment findings on a given day. Venipuncture: On the day of admission into the study and at the completion of SMT therapy, an experienced phlebotomist will perform venipuncture using standard procedures (antecubital fossa, 21gauge needle) in the seated position. Heparinized blood samples (10 ml each) will be collected and transferred (at room temperature) to the laboratory within an hour of collection for the preparation of whole blood cultures as described below . Laboratory studies 1. Induction of inflammatory cytokines To assess cytokine production in vitro, a whole blood (WB) culture system will be utilized (19). Briefly, multiple sets of WB cultures representing different treatment/culture conditions for each subject will be prepared. Cultures will be stimulated at initiation with 10 μg/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for the induction of TNFα and IL-1β production. Phytohemagglutinin (PHA, 10 µg/ml) alone and in combination with LPS will be used to induce production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10 and 2 chemokines, CCL2 and CCL3 . Cultures will be maintained at 37C (Celsius) in a humidified 5% C02 incubator. As clinical conditions involving inflammatory responses may cause a time shift in the capacity for cytokine production (19, 27), the levels of the studied mediators (TNFα, IL-1β, IL-1ra, IL-10, CCL2 and CCL3) will be examined at 24 h intervals in culture supernatants harvested between 24-72h post-initiation. Aliquots of the supernatants will be stored at -76C (Celsius) until tested. This model will allow investigation of the relation between the releases of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators. 2. Determinations of cytokine levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay The levels of TNFα, IL-1β , and IL-10 and IL-1ra in supernatants from whole blood cultures will be determined by specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) using DuoSet ELISA development system for natural and recombinant human cytokines (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) as described previously (9, 11), and Quantikine Immunoassay Kits will be used for CCL2 and CCL3 determinations. All immunoassay procedures, including reagent and sample diluent preparations, will be carried out as per manufacturer's recommendations. Each of the studied samples will be tested at least twice at 2-4 different dilutions. Statistical analyses All of the studied mediators will be measured for the LBP patients and asymptomatic subjects at baseline and at the completion of the treatment period. For Question 1 (the primary outcome), baseline comparison for each TNFα and IL-1β will be compared between symptomatic subjects (acute and chronic) versus asymptomatic control subjects. Two unpaired t-tests will be used to test the associated hypothesis. For Question 2, the mean pre-post difference scores will be compared for each of TNFα and IL-1β between the three groups (acute, chronic and asymptomatic) using an ANOVA. If baseline values are significantly different between groups (as hypothesized from Question 1), then ANCOVA will be used to account for this difference. It is anticipated that the sample size is sufficiently large to accommodate this analysis. However, after determining the results for Question 2, a power analysis will be completed. If the study is insufficiently powered for this question, then another sample size estimate will be calculated to inform future work. For other pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines measured in this study, regression modeling will be used in an attempt to predict cytokine responses. It is understood that any model created during this process will need to be confirmed in a future investigation. Both models created and descriptive data derived from the investigation will be used to inform future work. Time frame Based on experience, up to 5 subjects per week can be tested. However, based on condition prevalence, we project that patient recruitment and sample collection will take 8-12 months. Cytokine level determinations in cell cultures derived from the three groups of participants will lag behind by 3-4 months, and data analysis will be completed within another 2 months. Preparation of manuscripts will require an additional 4-6 months. Thus we anticipate completing this project within 18 -24 months of initiation of the study.\",\n",

In addition, South Asians in Canada have substantially lower levels of leisure-time physical activity. At present, we do not know the answers to the following questions: 1. Is a conventional (standard) physical activity program that has proven effective at reducing inner abdominal fat and heart disease risk factors in populations of European background be effective in South Asians? 2. Is an alternative physical activity program commonly practiced by South Asians (such as bhangra dance) be effective at reducing inner abdominal fat and heart disease risk factors in South Asians?

       "  'Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents a spectrum of diseases ranging from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the progressive form of liver disease that can lead to cirrhosis and liver-related mortality in persons who drink little or no alcohol. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) represents the more severe end of this spectrum and is characterized by steatosis, ballooning degeneration and lobular inflammation with or without fibrosis. The etiology of NASH is not completely understood, but it is often associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia and insulin resistance. Lipotoxicity, insulin resistance and oxidative stress appear to be central to the pathogenesis of NASH. Currently, there is no FDA approved treatment for NAFLD/NASH. Weight loss and exercise are the recommended but often difficult maintain these lifestyle changes in the long term and therefore therapeutic agents have been investigated. Ezetimibe is an LDL lowering agent that works through inhibition of the fat absorption from the small intestine. In this study, we propose to treat 50 patients with NASH with either Ezetimibe or placebo for 24 weeks. After an initial evaluation for insulin sensitivity, MRI liver fat distribution and liver biopsy, patients will receive either 10 mg/day of Ezetimibe or placebo. Patients will be monitored at regular intervals for symptoms of liver disease, side effects of Ezetimibe and serum biochemical and metabolic indices. At the end of 24-weeks, patients will have a repeat medical evaluation, liver MRI and liver biopsy. Pre and post treatment MRI-derived liver fat content, liver histology and insulin sensitivity will be compared. The primary end point of successful therapy will be improvement in hepatic steatosis measured by MRI. Secondary end points will be improvement in insulin sensitivity, liver histology and liver biochemistry.',\n",

       "  \"At MGH and BWH, HCW exposed to blood or visibly bloody fluids are referred immediately to Occupational Health Services. The person whose blood or body fluid is the source of an occupational exposure should be evaluated for HBV, HCV, and HIV infection. Information available in the medical record at the time of exposure, or from the source person, might confirm or exclude bloodborne virus infection. If the HBV, HCV, and/or HIV infection status of the source is unknown, the source patient should be informed of the incident and tested for serologic evidence of bloodborne virus infection, including HBsAg, HCV antibody, and HIV antibody. Reactive results by EIA for anti-HCV are confirmed by HCV RNA PCR, which is tested using Roche COBAS TaqMan quantitative assay (Roche Molecular Systems) with a lower limit of quantitation of < 43 IU/ml. HCV RNA testing is performed twice weekly at MGH and BWH. In the event that the source patient's HCV antibody is positive and the HCV RNA is below the lower limit of detection, an HCV Recombinant Immunoblot Assay (RIBA) will be ordered: if the RIBA is negative, then the positive HCV antibody is interpreted as a false positive result, and the source patient is not infected with HCV. If the RIBA is positive, the source patient will then receive serial HCV RNA testing For HCW exposed to an HCV-positive source, HCV antibody testing is performed at the time of exposure. Per standard practices recommended by Partners Occupational Health Services, HCV RNA testing of HCW is not performed at the time of exposure, unless the HCV antibody test is positive. For the current study, if a HCW meets inclusion criteria (specifically, has an exposure through needlestick injury with a hollow-bore needle to a source patient who is anti-HCV(+) and HCV RNA (+); and the HCW is anti-HCV Ab negative) and is interested in enrolling in the study, HCV RNA testing of eligible HCW will be performed at the initial visit. For potential study enrollment, patients will be directly referred from Partners Occupational Health Services (BWH or MGH). They will be responsible for contacting study personnel by pager. In the event that the exposure occurs after the Occupational Health Services office is closed, the HCW will be evaluated in the Emergency Room as per standard protocol, and will be referred to study personnel the following business day. The HCW will then be screened with an interview in person, and patients with an appropriate exposure will be eligible for inclusion. Study drug will be offered to subjects who were exposed to potentially HCV-infected blood after needlestick injury with hollow-bore needles. Blood on intact skin is considered low-risk and, therefore, treatment will not be recommended. Other unusual injuries/exposures will be included on an individual basis by study physicians. Once the HCW signs informed consent to participate in the study, he/she will be offered a prescription for PEP with telaprevir 750 mg three times per day for 4 weeks within a five (5) day period from his/her exposure. Telaprevir has been shown to interact with both HIV protease inhibitors and reverse transcriptase inhibitors through their activity upon the CYP3A enzyme. With respect to the interactions between telaprevir and HIV protease inhibitors, it is not recommended to co-administer darunavir/ritonavir, fosamprenavir/ritonavir, or lopinavir/ritonavir with telaprevir[19]. In addition, regarding the use of reverse transcriptase inhibitors, concomitant administration of telaprevir and efavirenz resulted in reduced steady-state exposures to telaprevir and efavirenz. Van Heeswijk et al conducted three open-label, randomized cross-over trials among HIV and HCV negative healthy volunteers, and found that therapeutic levels of telaprevir, efavirenz, and tenofovir were maintained when the telaprevir dose was increased to 1250 mg three-times daily. As a result of these interactions, in cases where a HCW is exposed to HCV and HIV and elects to take HIV PEP, telaprevir will be offered for HCV PEP if one of the following HIV PEP regimens is prescribed: 1. Tenofovir/Emtricitabine (Truvada) + Atazanavir/Ritonavir 2. Tenofovir/Emtricitabine (Truvada) + Raltegravir All decisions regarding post-exposure prophylaxis for HCW exposed to HCV and HIV will be discussed with the HIV/ID fellow. Furthermore, for HCW who are HIV-infected and receiving HAART at the time of study enrollment, discussions will be held between the study team and the Infectious Disease specialist who is managing the HAART regimen of the HCW, in order to determine whether the patient could safely take telaprevir for HCV PEP. The HCW will have anti-HCV testing performed, along with stored serum for lookbacks if necessary, as is the current protocol in Occupational Health. In addition to the usual laboratories drawn by occupational health (HCV antibody at week 0, HCV RNA at weeks 4 and 12), a blood count including differential will be required prior to consideration of study drug. At week 4, all enrolled patients will have quantitative HCV viral load testing (regardless of treatment election). If HCV RNA is detectable, HCW will be referred to GI/Hepatology for consideration of intensified antiviral therapy. If negative for patients in the treatment arm, then telaprevir will be discontinued at this time. At week 12 and 24, HCV RNA testing will be repeated. If positive, the patient will be referred for intensified antiviral therapy. Week 24 HCV RNA testing is necessary to look for the possibility that early prophylaxis with telaprevir delays the onset of hepatitis C infection.\",\n",

       "  'A breast biopsy in the operating room may be needed in up to 15% of patients with an abnormality on mammogram. When an abnormality is present but there is no palpable mass, the abnormality must be localized with a wire before going to the operating room. This technique is also used when a breast cancer is present but there is no mass, in order to perform a targeted lumpectomy. Once the abnormality is surgically removed, the specimen with the wire is taken to the breast imaging department for a specimen x-ray to ensure that the targeted abnormality is present within the specimen. If the abnormality is close to the edge of the specimen, additional tissue is often removed. A newer method for evaluating the specimen is to perform imaging in the operating room. Portable digital mammography units are available for this purpose. The Biovision digital specimen mammography system is FDA-approved and currently in use in over 200 centers in the United States. Several studies have shown that intra-operative digital mammography is as accurate as standard specimen mammography and takes less time to perform. It may also decrease the chance of having to go back to the operating room to take more breast tissue after lumpectomy because of cancer cells near teh margin(s) of the specimen on final pathology. Having to go back to the operating room to take more tissue is called a re-excision. The purpose of this study is to compare standard specimen mammography to intra-operative specimen mammography to quantify potential operating room time savings and to determine if the use of intra-operative specimen mammography decreases re-excision rates. We aim to see if intra-operative specimen mammography is more efficient and if it decreases re-excision rates.',\n",

       "  'Tropical fevers have been a diagnostic challenge from the antiquity. Nowadays, despite the availability of good diagnostic capacities, undifferentiated febrile illnesses continue to be a thorny problem for travel physicians. In developing countries, the scarcity of skilled personnel and adequate laboratory facilities makes the differential diagnosis of fevers even more complex. Health care workers must often rely on syndrome-oriented empirical approaches to treatment and might overestimate or underestimate the likelihood of certain diseases. For instance Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD) contribute substantially to the burden of persistent (more than 1 week) fevers in the Tropics, causing considerable mortality and major disability. These diseases are however rarely diagnosed at primary health care (PHC) level. The difficulty in establishing the cause of febrile illnesses has resulted in omission or delays in treatment, irrational prescriptions with polytherapy, increasing cost and development of drug resistance. In resource-limited settings, clinical algorithms constitute a valuable aid to health workers, as they facilitate the therapeutic decision in the absence of good laboratory capacities. There is a critical lack of appropriate diagnostic tools to guide treatment of NTDs. While clinical algorithms have been developed for some NTDs, in most cases they remain empirical. Besides, they rarely take into account local prevalence data, do not adequately represent the spectrum of patients and differential diagnosis at the primary care level and often have not been properly validated. The purpose of the study is to develop evidence-based Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT)-supported diagnostic guidelines for patients with persistent fever (≥ 1 week) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Sudan, Cambodia and Nepal.',\n",
       "  'This study is part of a large European Union (EU)-funded research project called NIDIAG that aims at developing integrated, evidence-based syndromic approach to improve management of NTD-related clinical syndromes. NIDIAG targets three non-specific clinical syndromes: the persistent fever, neurological, and intestinal syndrome. The objective of the project is to establish diagnostic guidelines for each of this syndrome, with a particular focus on severe and treatable neglected infectious diseases. The developed guidelines should integrate relevant Point-of-Care (POC)tests. The persistent fever syndrome targeted by NIDIAG is defined as presence of fever for at least one week. The list of diseases - both NTD and other Infectious Diseases (ID) - that frequently cause persistent (≥1 week) fever in the study countries includes: Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL), Human Africa Trypanosomiasis (HAT), Enteric (typhoid, paratyphoid) fever, Malaria, Brucellosis, Melioidosis, Tuberculosis, Amoebic liver abscess, Relapsing fever, HIV, Rickettsial diseases, and Leptospirosis.

       "  'The purpose of this study to conduct a pilot, randomized trial in stable HD patients to evaluate the effect of gradual, step-wise reduction of post-hemodialysis target weight, combined with diligent dietary sodium restriction and reduction in dialysate sodium exposure on hydration/volume status and blood pressure (BP) control.',\n",
       "  \"Fluid-weight management is critical for dialysis patients 1, 2. Previous clinical trials have not comprehensively addressed the application of a strategy combining both sodium restriction and a progressive, but gradual challenge of post dialysis target weight for BP and fluid-weight management in hemodialysis (HD). The investigators postulate that a protocolized, stepwise and gradual challenge of post-hemodialysis target weight when combined with diligent dietary sodium restriction <2000mg sodium/day, will lead to better hydration/volume status and BP control in HD patients. A randomized, two parallel arm trial (n=40) among HD patients is proposed, that compares this comprehensive strategy in one group versus 'usual' HD volume/hydration and BP management in the control group. The two primary outcomes are change in volume/hydration status (assessed by bioelectrical impedance analysis-BIA) and change in BP (pre-dialysis in-center readings, home self-monitored readings as well as 44-hour interdialytic BP). Secondary outcomes include change in target post-dialysis weight, slope of on-line relative plasma volume monitoring (using Crit-line monitors), utilization and change, if any, in antihypertensive regimen, change in interdialytic weight gain, objectively assessed salt-appetite, thirst score, frequency of intradialytic hypotension, cramps and duration of post-dialysis fatigue and recovery, time to achievement of dry weight and laboratory parameters (hemoglobin, albumin, brain natriuretic peptide-BNP, aldosterone and hsCRP). The trial will be 14-weeks in duration and will involve comprehensive assessment of study parameters at baseline, middle and end of the trial. It is anticipated that the trial will lead to the the development of a simple and practical approach for volume and BP control in HD patients that will subsequently need to be studied on a larger scale, i.e., a larger, multicenter study with hard endpoints of death and hospitalization.\",\n",

       "  'The purpose of this study is to determine whether Fruitflow-II, Resveratrol (resVida), alone or in combination, are effective in the treatment of memory problems in adult patients with memory impairment. We also evaluate effects of these medications on blood flow to the brain and fitness, to find whether the possible improvement in memory is associated with the alterations in these parameters.',\n",
       "  'Accumulating evidence suggests that tomato consumption has cardiovascular benefits, primarily through increasing blood flow in vivo; the active ingredient in tomato, or its extract (Fruitflow) have been shown to inhibit glycoprotein IIb/IIIa, similar to aspirin (which has antiplatelet activity and is used for secondary prevention of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events in patients). Considering the fact that Fruitflow can improve the platelet function and peripheral blood flow, we hypothesized that Fruitflow can also increase the blood flow in the brain and thereby possibly enhance memory and cognitive function in middle-aged or elderly people who have memory complaints. Therefore, the initial goal of our study is to evaluate the effects of Fruitflow on brain blood and cardiovascular function by using Transcranial Doppler ultrasound (to check for changes in cerebral blood flow), cardiovascular fitness testing (to check for changes in VO2-max and stroke volume), and neurocognitive evaluation (to check for changes in memory and executive function). Many pathways such as inflammation and oxidative stress are involved in the pathophysiology of memory loss with ageing. Recent studies have shown that a natural compound found in the skin of red grapes and also in wine, called \"Resveratrol\", have beneficial effects for prevention of cognitive decline by reducing inflammation and improving cardiovascular function. Therefore, our next goal is to evaluate whether administration of Resveratrol, by itself or in combination with Fruitflow, can improve brain blood flow, VO2-max, and cognitive performance. Thus our clinical trial will have the following 4 arms: Fruitflow, Resveratrol, Fruitflow/Resveratrol combination, and placebo for each supplement. The results of the study will potentially provide evidence that these natural supplements can have significant cardioprotective and neuroprotective properties in middle-aged and elderly adults. Subjects (between 50 and 80 years old) complaining of memory problem who have MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination) above 27 will be recruited from patients of Dr. Majid Fotuhi (PI at the Neurology Institute for Brain Health and Fitness).

       "  'This study will determine whether the likely success of closing a hole in the eardrum can be predicted by testing Eustachian tube function. The Eustachian tube is a natural tube that connects the back of the nose with the middle ear. When a person goes up in an airplane and their ears \"pop\" or when one yawns and their ears \"pop\", that is the Eustachian tube opening. The Eustachian tube is responsible for keeping the air pressure in the middle ear the same as in the environment and keeping the middle ear free of fluid. It is thought that in children with middle-ear disease, the muscles that open the Eustachian tube do not work very well; this seems to get better in many children as they get older. It is thought that poor Eustachian tube function is the cause of failures when holes in the eardrum are patched and also for the recurrence of fluid in the middle-ear. The primary goal of this study is to see whether it can be predicted, based on testing Eustachian tube function before surgery, whether patching the eardrum will be successful and whether fluid will come back in the ear after it is patched.',\n",
       "  \"This study involves 1 visit to Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC for Eustachian tube function testing and 2 visits, at approximately 6 months and at 12 months, after surgery to examine the ears. Entry (Visit 1; approximately 40-60 minutes) At the entry visit, the child's medical history will be reviewed to ensure he/she is eligible for the study. The parent will be asked questions about their family, including family size, pets, medical history, tobacco smoke exposure, education and occupation, and living conditions. They will also be asked questions about their child, regarding such things as breastfeeding, daycare, tobacco smoke exposure and allergies, and a detailed history of middle-ear disease will be recorded. The child will have an examination of the ears, nose and throat. Tympanometry will be done, which can help to tell whether there is fluid in the middle ear and whether there is an opening/hole in the eardrum. This is a common office procedure and is done by inserting a small probe (a rubber or plastic tube that measures ear pressure) half way into the ear canal and changing the pressure in the probe. That pressure change is small, can be felt but is rarely associated with any discomfort. The function of the child's Eustachian tube on the side of the eardrum that is going to be patched will be tested. A small ear plug will be sealed partway into the child's ear canal. This plug is attached to a machine that can change the pressure in the ear and measure the pressure at which the Eustachian tube opens and closes, as well as the ease of airflow through the Eustachian tube and the ability to open the Eustachian tube during swallowing. The tests only require that the child not pull the ear plug from his/her ear and perform certain (age-appropriate) procedures designed to open his/her Eustachian tube such as swallowing with an open and pinched nose, blowing against a closed nose and deep breathing. The total time for testing is about 20 minutes and this period is broken into times of rest and times of tests. If the child has holes in both eardrums that are going to be repaired, testing may take 40 minutes. After the entry testing: The child's ear surgeon will take a picture of the eardrum at the time of surgery to document the size of the hole. If the child does not require another surgical procedure after the surgery to close the eardrum because of failure of the hole to close or recurrence of ear problems such as infection or fluid in the ear, the child will have study visits for examination of the ears, nose and throat as well as tympanometry at approximately 6 months and 12 months after surgery. If he or she is being seen by the ear surgeon around these times, the study visit and their clinic visit can be done at the same time.\",\n",

       "  'To search for suitable pharmacodynamic biomarkers, i.e., with high specificity for calcineurin inhibition and most affected by inter-individual variability, our works aimed at exploring the pharmacodynamics of CNI, the strength and variability of signal translation along the calcineurin pathway, as well as the steps where sources of internal (genetic) or external variability are the most influential. In order to achieve this, we assessed simultaneously NFAT1 translocation into the nucleus of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) (NFTA1 being the main NAFT isoform in resting and activated lymphocytes), the intracellular expression of IL-2 in CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets and the membrane expression of CD25 (IL-2Rα), a surface marker of T cells activation, in T cells at large. A non-interventional clinical trial was set up in healthy volunteers, patients registered on a liver transplantation waiting list (WLP) and liver transplant recipients (LTR). A different question was addressed in each group: The healthy volunteer study (n=35): explored TAC PD along the calcineurin pathway by exposing PBMC ex-vivo; modelled signal translation along this cascade; examined the interindividual variability of TAC PD parameters; and investigated the sources of the variability observed and their contribution at each step of the calcineurin pathway. Furthermore, it allowed us to evaluate the analytical variability of our techniques as well as the intra-individual variability of TAC PD parameters. WLP (n=19) were enrolled to confirm in patients with liver diseases the results obtained in healthy volunteers, as well as to test the potential influence of their initial disease on the ex-vivo pharmacodynamics of TAC. The aims of the transversal study of LTR on CNI (n=80) were to further explore the interindividual variability in the PD of CNI in realistic clinical conditions, i.e. in situations of residual PD activities under tacrolimus or cyclosporine exposure, and the potential pharmacogenetic (PG) sources of such variability. The (still small) group of liver transplant patients (n=9) enrolled immediately before transplantation and followed-up with serial monitoring along the first year post-transplantation was intended to explore the relationships between CNI PD and clinical responses.',\n",

Considering potential dropouts or withdrawals during the study, the intention is to recruit an additional 10% to compensate for the cohorts, as they allow. The study design does not suppose applying masking methods, since it is an open study. All data required in the registration forms will be recorded, however in case of persistent failure, will be properly documented the reasons for the absence. Each instance will merit a particular analysis, dated and signed.

Data will be validated according to the data management plan, jointly defined by the principal investigator and the biostatistician, including freezing and thawing processes. Pharmacokinetic, pharmacogenetic and pharmacodynamic modeling will be done using R software. Data back ups will be run everyday, and will be archived on tape and a USB storage drive.

Under national rates, will be studied at least 30 healthy volunteers, 50 patients and 12 patients with end stage liver disease enlisted for liver transplantation, with serial follow-up during the first year. Statistical analysis will be performed according to the principle of \"intention to treat\", and will be the responsible for at least one specialist in biostatistics. It will be developed a descriptive analysis of all variables collected. Categorical variables will be expressed in percentages and number of observations. Continuous variables will be expressed as mean and coefficient of variation or median and 25th and 75th percentiles, minimum and maximum. Lof transformations will be held whenever needed. The variables will be compared between groups according to the patient\\'s original listing (intention to treat). They will be calculated and presented the estimated relative risks and their effect with 95% confidence intervals. For comparison of categorical variables, it will be used the Chi-square test or Fisher\\'s exact test as appropriate. For comparison of continuous variables, it will be used the test \"t\" of Student. For variables that develop with time, they will be represented by Kaplan-Meier curves and compared using the \"log-rank\" test. Their relative risk with 95% confidence interval will be calculated. To identify variables associated with different responses multivariate linear analysis, logistic or Cox proportional will be used. All analyzes will be performed with hypothesis testing and a 2-tailed significance level of 5%. The program used will be R. Multivariate analysis will be held corrected according Bonferroni\\'s criteria. We have established standard operating procedures to describe blood collection instances, biological fluids sampling circuit, evaluation of the candidates to include in the study, verification of the inclusion criteria, monitoring of patients during the study, record of undesirable events and report of adverse drug reactions, terminating tracking.',\n",

       "  \"The American Medical Association's (AMA) Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment is used to rate loss of function and determine compensation and ability to work after injury or illness. The AMA Guides are used by many different systems to determine compensable levels of impairment. However, there are few studies that evaluate reliability or construct validity. (1) In the professional community there exists considerable controversy regarding the accuracy and usefulness of the AMA Guides. (2,3) Commentaries have noted that the AMA Guides do not provide a valid, reliable, evidence-based system for the rating of impairments. (4) Some have argued that the impairment ratings do not reflect an individual's actual loss of function and quality of life (QOL). The AMA guides 5th edition was based on loss of range of motion (ROM). The new 6th edition of the AMA guides is based on diagnosis and inclusion of functional outcomes assessments in the determination of impairment ratings. (5) In the orthopaedic literature the use of patient-derived, objective outcome measures has substantially expanded QOL instruments are categorized as general health or as condition-specific questionnaires. The Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form (SF-36) is a general health-based survey of quality of life. It has been validated and is used widely across medical disciplines. (6) The SF-36 was constructed to survey health status in the Medical Outcomes Study. It was designed for use in clinical practice and research, health policy evaluations, and general population surveys. The SF-36 was constructed for self-administration by persons 14 years of age and older, and for administration by a trained interviewer in person or by telephone. (7) The SF-36 is perhaps the most widely used health-related quality of life (HRQoL) survey instrument in the world today. It is comprised of 36 items that assess eight health concepts: physical functioning, role limitations caused by physical health problems, role limitations caused by emotional problems, social functioning, emotional well-being, energy/fatigue, pain, and general health perceptions. Physical and mental health summary scores are also derived from the eight RAND-36 scales. (8) The aim of this study is to determine the amount of correlation between the by orthopaedic surgeon objectively calculated percentage of impairment scored by the American Medical Association guides to the evaluation of permanent impairment and the by patient subjectively indicated health-related quality of life scored by the SF-36. Hypotheses: Because of and inclusion of functional outcomes assessments in the determination of impairment ratings the AMA guide 6th edition will have a better correlation with the SF-36. The 6th edition of the AMA guide is based on diagnosis en yield lower impairment percentages than the AMA guide 5th edition that is based on loss of ROM. The SF-36 will have better correlation with the impairment ratings for lower extremities injuries than for upper extremities because it is less valid for the upper extremities.\",\n",

In response to this situation, China introduced methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) in 2004, which is now dispensed by 701 clinics serving 295,000 clients. Despite this impressive scale-up, China's MMT programs still face serious challenges, including high drop-out rates, a large number of clients who continue to use heroin during MMT, a gap between clients' needs and services availability, providers' lack of skills in counseling and education, and stigma linked to resistance to harm reduction. This study aims to address these challenges.

The Specific Aims of the study are as follows: 1. To examine whether providers in the intervention group, compared to providers in the control group, demonstrate improved adherence to MMT protocols, decreased prejudicial attitudes, increased interactions with clients, and increased communications with clients on risk reduction. 2. To examine whether MMT clients in the intervention group, compared to clients in the control group, demonstrate improved treatment adherence/retention, decreased concurrent drug use, increased motivation for behavior change, improved mental health, increased positive support, and reduced HIV risk behaviors. 3.

       "  'Successful treatment of traumatic brain injury (TBI)-induced mood lability may reduce or eliminate drinking behaviors in persons with alcohol abuse/dependence (AA/D) and affective lability following TBI. Observed clinically, the symptoms of poorly regulated affective expression of AA/D+TBI patients who reach alcohol abstinence do not appear to be those of an idiopathic mood or anxiety disorder. These symptoms do not present the severity or the same natural courses as do Major Depressive Disorder, Bipolar Illness, or Anxiety Disorder, for example. Instead, both symptoms and course appear more characteristic of the sustained affect lability often observed following TBI. This observation suggests that TBI survivors represent a patient group for whom treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms following TBI may alleviate both TBI-related affect lability and also heavy ethanol use by treating the condition that is contextually related to excessive alcohol use. Based on this concept of consequently treating AA/D through the management of post-TBI affective lability, this study was conducted observing the efficacy of divalproex sodium on the severity of affective lability and AA/D in persons suffering from a moderate TBI. Divalproex sodium has been shown to ameliorate mood disorders, even in those with substance abuse problems. This drug has also shown positive results as an alternate medication to benzodiazapines in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal, significantly reducing the progression of withdrawal symptoms in patients.',\n",
       "  'Despite the body\\'s natural healing during the first year after a head injury, many veterans who have suffered even mild brain injuries find themselves easily upset or fearful as they go about their daily lives. While these reactions to the world around them were easily managed before the head injury, they now occur with little or no interruption and are exceedingly difficult to manage. Such reactions include a sense of always being upset or fearful that often makes it difficult to get along with family members, friends, coworkers, and employers. This may lead to broken marriages, unemployment, and even homelessness. Some people with head injuries try to manage their unmanageable moods by drinking alcohol because it can create a sense of calm. However, alcohol\\'s actions are short in duration. Most find that they have to drink more and more for a similar calming effect, and they soon become dependent on alcohol. This makes working and being part of their families even more difficult. To treat the unmanageable mood, we tried a medicine called valproate, one that eases mood problems in people without head injury. We gave valproate to head injured persons with mood problems in a \"non-blinded\" study where both the doctor and the patient knew that the medicine was valproate and both were optimistic that it would work. In a small sample of eighteen people, 85% found mood relief and most of those either stopped drinking alcohol or drank much less than before. However, this might have been because both the doctor and patient were hopeful that the medication would make the patient feel better or because the medicine actually worked. The only way to know for sure if the medicine works is to perform a study in which people receive either valproate or a sugar pill while neither they nor their doctor know which one they are taking. This is called a double blind study, as proposed here, and will involve nearly three times as many head injured persons as the first study. If it is successful, the new study will show that valproate treatment helps head injured people manage their moods and allows them to return to families, friends, and work. It will also show that they drink alcohol less or not at all, improving their health even further. Then doctors will know that they can use this medicine for large numbers of people who suffer from head injury and help them to lead normal lives. If the outcome of the study shows that the medicine works well, doctors can then use this medicine to treat people with head injury immediately after the study results are published.',\n",

In an attempt to improve cure rates while reducing harmful effects from drugs, oncologists are developing new treatment protocols. One such protocol, entitled dose-adjusted EPOCH-R, utilizes two major new strategies. First, the treatment approach utilizes continuous infusion of chemotherapy over four days, instead of being administered over minutes or hours. Secondly, the doses of some medications involved are increased or decreased based on how the drugs affect the subject's ability to produce blood cells, which is used as a measure of how rapidly the body is processing drugs. Using this approach in adults, researchers have shown improved cure rates in these cancers. Additionally, the harmful effects experienced by patients has been mild, with mucositis, severe infections, and tumor lysis syndrome occurring rarely. However, this new dosing method has never been used in children, and the effectiveness and side effects of this new method are unknown in children. The purpose of this study is to look at the safety of dose-adjusted EPOCH-R in the treatment of children with mature B-cell cancers, and to see if we can maintain cure rates (as has been shown in adults). This study represents the first trial of dose-adjusted EPOCH-R in children.\",\n",

At baseline, medical history was evaluated and clinical examination, ECG, lung function, Fraction of exhaled NO measurement and histamine provocation were performed. During a second visit, patients stayed for approximately one hour in a chamber to simulate high altitude (FiO2:11%) and performed a maximal exercise test after 30 minutes of rest. Oxygen saturation, ECG and oxygen consumption were continuously monitored. Lung function and fraction of exhaled NO were assessed before and after the test. Also, peripheral blood was drawn before and after the test. This test allowed us to identify whether patients may develop acute mountain sickness later on during expedition. During a third visit, patients stayed for 24 hours in a indoor ski centre to practice climbing techniques, building up a tent and working with the specialized materials. Temperature at the ski piste varies between -5°C and -10°C. Lung function, fraction of exhaled NO and induced sputum was assessed before and after the stay at the ski centre. During the expedition, clinical status, heart rate and oxygen saturation were measured daily. Also, lung function and fraction of exhaled NO were regularly measured. A screening for acute mountain sickness was performed daily. Asthmatics patients were supported by two pulmonologist.

       "  'The overall goal of this proposal is to better understand the basis of structural airway changes in severe asthma and how asthma exacerbations may contribute to their progression over time. The investigators propose to study a well-characterized cohort of adult and pediatric subjects with asthma using a multidisciplinary state-of-the-art approach. We hypothesize that severe asthma exacerbations, in some patients, are associated with incomplete recovery and activation of airway inflammatory cells in a regional distribution. The end result is a more permanent and less reversible airway obstruction that is a prominent feature of severe asthma.',\n",
       "  'We have shown that patients with severe asthma have heterogeneous regional ventilation defects and air trapping. Some of these defects are persistent, while others can be provoked with virus-induced exacerbations or bronchial challenge and recur in the same general areas on repeated challenge, suggesting localized airway dysfunction. In preliminary studies, inflammatory parameters tended to be more prominent in segments that showed ventilation defects on imaging. Therefore, we hypothesize that asthma exacerbations, in some patients, are associated with incomplete recovery and activation of airway inflammatory cells in a regional distribution. This leads to enhanced airway injury with airway dysfunction as reflected by ventilation defects and air trapping, and a more generalized increase in disease severity. To evaluate this hypothesis we propose the following specific aims: 1. To refine phenotyping of severe asthma using new variables from multiple domains in a large longitudinal patient cohort; and to determine the contribution of asthma exacerbations to disease progression. 2. To characterize regional obstructive patterns at baseline and their relationship to changes in pulmonary function; and to determine how incremental changes in regional airway dysfunction after asthma exacerbations may contribute to severe asthma. 3. To determine the contribution of established and novel biomarkers (YKL-40, vWF, & P-selectin), in refining the severe asthma phenotypes and the role of inflammatory cells in causing airway injury following virus-induced asthma exacerbations with subsequent development of ventilation defects.',\n",

There is no research utilizing pain threshold perception as an objective outcome of these treatments. Only one study compared the two treatment techniques and concluded that future research should be completed which includes manual therapy for the thoracic spine. (Cleland 2007) The subjects will be patients at clinics owned by Physiotherapy Associates, Fit Physical Therapy, and Allegheny and Chesapeake PT who seek physical therapy services for nontraumatic neck pain. Participation will be entirely voluntary. Patients will be offered a chance to participate in the research project on their initial visit for Physical Therapy. If the PT identifies an appropriate patient they will ask if they are interested in being a research subject. The Physical Therapist recruiting subjects all have completed their Doctor of Physical Therapy Degree and have advanced training in manual Physical Therapy. The techniques employed are considered standard practice and are defined as entry level skills by the Commission of Accredidation of Physical Therapy Programs. These techniques are typically taught in DPT degree programs. If the patient is interested, a description of the study will be provided. A consent form will be given to all participants. Research Procedures: 1. Patients who present to one of three Physical Therapy clinics, under the direction of three advanced clinicians, will be assessed for their potential participation in this research. The treating clinician will recruit appropriate subjects based on includion and exclusion criteria and their PT diagnosis. Those that meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be given the consent form to determine if they wish to participate. Each researcher will have formal training in these techniques. Two of the clinicians have received their Orthopedic Clinical Specialists certification under the examination prcess outlined by the American Physical Therapy association. A third researcher has obtained his fellowship designation from the American Academy of Orthopedic Manual Physical Therapy. This skill is deemed entry level by the the Accredidation Board of the American Physical Therapy Educators. All Therapists will undergo a prestudy hands on education program to ensure the use of similar techniques. 2. If after reading the consent form they agree to participate, they will be given one additional form, the Pain Catastrophizing scale, and asked to complete it. The scale, NDI, cervical ROM, age, and birthdate will be recorded on a sheet contained in the patient's clinical chart. 3. The PT evaluation will then be completed. 4. They will then be randomized into one of two groups based on a roll of a die: Group One: Mobilization Group: this group will receive grade 1,2,3,or 4 mobilization in prone based on the PT's clinical judgement. The treatment parameters will be recorded. Group Two: Grade 5 mobilization group: this group wil receive a grade 5 mobilization. 5. Additional treatment including patient eduation, modalities, and exercise will be completed as the PT deems appropriate, 6. The second visit will be scheduled within 24 to 48 hours. 7. The patient will complete the same forms as were completed during the initial evaluation (NDI, PCS) and return them so that the results may berecorded on the record sheet identified only with date of birth. 8. The treatment will be repeated including the manual technique and other treatment deemed appropriate by the PT. Additional treatment between the second and last visits will be under the sole discretion on the treating PT. 9. On the discharge visit, the patient will receive the same forms, and be asked how much, in terms of %, they feel they have improved. This information will be recorded on the deidentified sheet. Home exercise programs and patient educaiton will be issued as appropriate. A bubble goniometer will be used for range of motion assessment. This is a standard plastic device used in PT practice. A Wagner FDX digital force gauge algometer will measure pain pressure thresholds. Where survey instruments are involved, a copy of the instrument and, for surveys not created for this project, assurance that the principal investigator has proper approval to use them. The Neck Disability Index or NDI will be used. It is the professional standard for outcomes measures for people with neck pain. It has been shown to be valid and reliable. The Pain Castrophizing Scale will be used. It is a valid and reliable measure of a patient's perception of pain and is commonly used. The data will be collected by the treating Physical Therapist who has access to the patient record for treatment purposes. The data will not be used for purposes other that patient care and research purposes. Patient's data measures will be collected on a de-identified sheet marked with the patients birthday. The will be kept in a locked area in the clinic. The lead investigator will have access to the data when the study is completed and transfer it to a locked file cabinet in his office for data assessment. Following treatment the patient may have mild soreness over the area which was treated. This typically diminishes in 24 hours. the patient will be informed of this potential soreness. The use of heat and /or ice, exercise, and patient education provided by the Therapist concerning activities and posture will also lessen the soreness.\",\n",

       "  'The study is designed to compare the abuse liabilities of intranasal buprenorphine and buprenorphine/naloxone in individuals who are physically dependent on sublingual buprenorphine. The investigators hypothesize that the abuse liability of buprenorphine/naloxone is lower than that of buprenorphine alone.',\n",
       "  'Although sublingual buprenorphine is an effective treatment for opioid addiction, the medication itself has abuse liability and, in some countries, has largely replaced heroin as the opioid drug of choice. In response to the reports of diversion and abuse of sublingual (SL) buprenorphine, a potentially less abusable formulation of buprenorphine that contains naloxone is being marketed in several countries. However, the relative abuse liability of buprenorphine alone and the buprenorphine/naloxone combination in buprenorphine-dependent individuals is unclear. Preliminary data from a study funded by Schering-Plough Corporation suggest that the buprenorphine/naloxone combination, when given intravenously (IV), does indeed have less abuse liability than IV buprenorphine in buprenorphine-dependent individuals. In addition to IV abuse of buprenorphine, epidemiological data suggest that buprenorphine is widely abused by the intranasal (IN) route. However, no data exist on the abuse liability of either IN buprenorphine alone or the buprenorphine/naloxone combination. Several studies have shown that naloxone is an effective antagonist of opioid agonist effects when given intravenously, but it is not clear whether naloxone given intranasally is as effective as when it is given by other routes of administration. Some studies have suggested that they are equally effective (Loimer et al., 1994), but others have shown that naloxone given intranasally is less effective (i.e., has a slower onset of effects) than when given by other routes of administration (Kelly et al., 2005). How this may impact on the ability of naloxone to reduce the reinforcing effects of IN buprenorphine is unclear. The primary aim of the current study proposal is to compare the reinforcing effects of IN buprenorphine and buprenorphine/naloxone in IN opioid abusers who are maintained on SL buprenorphine using a study design parallel to that used in our recent studies of the abuse liability of IV buprenorphine and buprenorphine/naloxone. Placebo, heroin, and naloxone will be used as neutral, positive, and negative controls, respectively. Secondary aims are to compare the subjective, performance, and physiological effects of IN buprenorphine and buprenorphine/naloxone. Overall, this study will complement our investigations of IV buprenorphine products by allowing for a complete overview within the same laboratory self-administration model of both the intravenous and intranasal abuse liability of buprenorphine versus buprenorphine/naloxone in individuals maintained on buprenorphine. The primary aim of the study is to compare the reinforcing effects of IN buprenorphine and IN buprenorphine/naloxone in opioid abusers maintained on different doses of sublingual buprenorphine. Secondary aims of the study are to compare the subjective, performance and physiological effects of IN buprenorphine and IN buprenorphine/naloxone. IN-administered placebo (lactose powder), naloxone alone, and heroin alone will be tested as neutral, negative, and positive control conditions, respectively. Participants (N=12 completers) will reside on an inpatient unit (5-South) during a 7 to 8-week study. This research will provide useful information to clinicians treating opioid dependent individuals with buprenorphine, and importantly, will provide information about the abuse potential and effects of buprenorphine on multiple measures of human functioning.',\n",

       "  \"Hashimoto's thyroiditis is an autoimmune thyroid disease, which induced chronic inflammation of thyroid gland and destroys thyroid tissue. Hydroxychloroquine is used as disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) for treatment of several autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis(RA) for more than one century. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether hydroxychloroquine is effective in treatment of Hashimoto's thyroiditis.\",\n",
       "  \"Hashimoto's thyroiditis is an autoimmune thyroid disease, and when the disease progresses, thyroid function finally declined to hypothyroidism. There was no medical treatment recommended for patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, but currently at euthyroid state. Levothyroxine replacement therapy starts if patients become hypothyroid state. Hashimoto's thyroiditis is a T-cell mediated autoimmune thyroid disease. The major auto-antigens include thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and thyroglobulin. Anti-TPO antibodies induce antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and cause destruction of thyroid tissues. Antimalarial agents like hydroxychloroquine have several pharmacologic effects which may be involved in the treatment of rheumatic diseases, but the role of each is not known. These include interaction with sulphydryl groups, interference with enzyme activity (including phospholipase, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrogen-cytochrome C reductase, cholinesterase, proteases and hydrolases), DNA binding, stabilisation of lysosome membranes, inhibition of prostaglandin formation, inhibition of polymorphonuclear cell chemotaxis and phagocytosis.

       "  'Osteoporosis is characterized by decreased bone strength and it is prevalent among postmenopausal women but also occurs in men and women with underlying conditions or major risk factors associated with bone demineralization. Its chief clinical manifestations are vertebral and hip fractures, although fractures can occur at any skeletal site.The World Health Organization (WHO) operationally defines osteoporosis as a bone density that falls 2.5 standard deviations (SD) below the mean for young healthy adults of the same gender—also referred to as T-score of -2.5. Postmenopausal women who fall at the lower end of the young normal range (a T-score of >1 SD below the mean) are defined as having low bone density (osteopenia) and are also at increased risk of osteoporosis. More than 50% of the fractures, including hip fractures, among postmenopausal women occur in this group. Teriparatide is one of the most effective treatment options for osteoporosis. But the cost of teriparatide is prohibitively expensive and in countries like India with limited personal resources of the individuals, its not a feasible option in the majority of the patients with severe osteoporosis. The investigators aim to compare weekly versus daily teriparatide therapy in an open label non inferiority trial and if successful, the investigators anticipate, the cost of treatment could be reduced considerably so that treatment becomes more affordable to a larger number of patients. Also with weekly therapy, number of multiple injections could be brought down.',\n",

       "  'The Role of GLP-1 in Lipid Metabolism in Healthy Subjects and in Subjects After Bariatric Surgery',\n",
       "  'Individuals with obesity have an increased risk for heart disease and diabetes. There are current drugs on the market that target the hormone, Glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) to treat diabetes. The investigators want to determine if targeting this hormone will also help people with high cholesterol and triglycerides. In this study, the investigators are looking at the role of GLP-1 in healthy subjects and subjects that have had bariatric surgery.',\n",
       "  'Major consequences of the global pandemic of obesity include cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia. The dyslipidemia of obesity commonly consists of fasting hypertriglyceridemia with increased plasma very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and the presence of small, dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL). However, more recently, increased secretion of intestinally derived lipoproteins (LPs) has been recognized as contributing to this dyslipidemic profile and postprandial lipemia has been linked to adverse health outcomes. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), a hormone secreted during meal absorption that plays a key role in the control of plasma glucose has been implicated as a candidate hormone for regulating intestinal lipid metabolism. Studies in rodents demonstrate that treatment with the GLP-1R agonist; exendin-4 (Ex-4) reduced postprandial chylomicron (CM) production and CM-associated cholesterol and triglyceride (TG). Similar results were found in Type 2 diabetes (T2D) subjects treated with Ex-4; in these reports there was a reduction in both intestinally derived LP production and total plasma TG. The objective of this study is to determine whether GLP-1 is involved in the physiologic regulation of postprandial lipid metabolism in healthy women, and to test the hypothesis that the improved lipid parameters found in overweight women who have had bariatric surgery are mediated by GLP-1. The specific aims for this project will 1) determine if either pharmacologic treatment with GLP-1 and/or antagonism of endogenous GLP-1 activity improves postprandial lipid metabolism in healthy subjects and 2) determine the role of elevated postprandial GLP-1 levels on lipid metabolism in obese subjects who have had a sleeve gastrectomy. The investigators will use infusions of synthetic GLP-1 with the native hormone to confirm the lipid-lowering results that have been published using pharmacologic GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists. The investigators will also use the GLP-1R antagonist exendin-(9-39) to determine the role of endogenous GLP-1 on lipemia after a test meal. A demonstration that this is a physiologic action would expand the current understanding of lipid metabolism, provide new insight into the effects of bariatric surgery, and allow the design of more refined, mechanistic studies of this process. In addition, the potential for GLP-1R signaling to promote lipid metabolism has direct translational importance in that therapies already exist that could capitalize on this mechanism. Understanding the role of GLP-1R regulation of lipid absorption and clearance could lead to more appropriate targeting of GLP-1 based drugs to specific diabetic patients, i.e. ones with problematic dyslipidemia and higher risk for cardiovascular disease. Moreover, understanding the effects of GLP-1 on plasma lipids could eventually lead to new approaches for treating nondiabetic dyslipidemic persons.',\n",

       "  'Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection rate in China is about 3%, which means about 30 million patients. Combination therapy of ribavirin and interferons (IFN) is the standard clinical treatment of HCV chronical infections. However, overall rate of sustained virological response (SVR) still do not exceed 60% even with ribavirin and peg-IFN. Due to several virus- and patient-related factors, treatment is even less successful in certain populations, especially in HCV genotype 1 infection. Thus the standard therapy duration is optimized according to the virus genotype in the clinical practice. Nowadays, two direct antiviral agents (DAAs) have been approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of USA this year, which increases the SVR rate. However, high price, side effects and long duration render people to hesitate about the addition of the third drug in the traditional prescription. Predicting the outcome of traditional therapy is the cornerstone of the personalized therapy for HCV infected patients. In order to obtain an accurate prediction, different methods have been tried. Several indicators have been suggested to predict the final treatment outcomes. Rapid Virus Response (RVR), which indicates the non-detectable virus at the forth week since therapy starts, has been used to predict the final treatment outcome.Other indicators, including virus genotype, host genotype of IL-28B, human race and interferon stimulated genes (ISG) expression have also been shown to relate to and be able to predict the treatment outcomes to some extent. Here the investigators propose that the HCV virus dynamics analysis will give a more precise prediction for the therapy outcome. The general idea is that blood HCV titration data is obtained continuously in the early treatment period (first 2 weeks) of the patients who have strictly followed the therapy method. These titration data will be used to draw virus dynamics curve and calculate the corresponding parameters individually. The parameter(s) that can distinguish patients who reach the therapy evaluation standard from those who failed to reach the evaluation standard will be selected out, and such parameter(s) may be used to predict the therapy outcome of a new patient in the early stage of his/her treatment.',\n",

       "  'PDR is a leading cause of irreversible vision loss in North America. This disease is caused by the growth of abnormal blood vessels in the retina. These abnormal blood vessels can bleed inside the eye, causing a vitreous hemorrhage (VH). Sometimes when patients have this bleeding, a surgery called vitrectomy is required to remove the blood from within the eye. In order to reduce complications during the surgery, most retina surgeons will inject Avastin into the eye a few days before the surgery. Avastin (bevacizumab) is currently not approved by Health Canada to treat any ocular disease. Lucentis (ranibizumab) is approved by Health Canada as a treatment for age-related macular degeneration, diabetic macular edema, and retinal venous occlusive disease. While Avastin is not approved by Health Canada for the treatment of these diseases, the majority of retina specialists around the world are now using Avastin \"off-label\" to treat these diseases. That is because Avastin and Lucentis both tend to work equally well in these disease, but Avastin is significantly cheaper. While Avastin and Lucentis are generally regarded to be equal, there may be some differences between these two drugs that have not been discovered. The aim of this study is to look for these differences. Previous research by the investigators in this study has shown that injecting Avastin into eyes causes increased inflammatory proteins to develop inside the eye. This increase in these proteins was related to complications that developed after the vitrectomy surgery. Lucentis may be associated with less of an increase in inflammatory proteins (and less complications). The aim of this study will be to compare Avastin and Lucentis with respect to how they affect inflammatory proteins in the eye, as well as the rate of complications during surgery. Study participants will be divided into two arms (\"groups\") of 30 subjects. Subjects will receive Avastin or Lucentis a few days before vitrectomy surgery. The assignment will be random and the study is double-masked. Masking is done so that the investigators can clearly determine any differences between the 2 drugs.',\n",

Biolimus A9 is the therapeutic agent used in the BioFreedom drug coated stent. Biolimus A9 is a proprietary semi-synthetic sirolimus derivative. It is highly lipophilic, rapidly absorbed in tissues, and able to reversibly inhibit growth factor-stimulated cell proliferation. In this study, we use intracoronary optical coherence tomography (OCT) to evaluate the BioFreedom Stents after implantation regarding endovascular healing over time as primary objective; and also to evaluate secondary OCT, angiographic and clinical outcomes at various specific time points.\",\n",
       "  \"Intra-coronary stenting is currently the standard of care post-balloon angioplasty for ischemic heart disease. Traditionally, bare metal stent (BMS) is used but in recent years it has been largely been replaced by drug-eluting stent (DES) which has reduced rates of restenosis. (1) However, the long term safety of DES still remains controversial due to reports of late stent thrombosis which presumably occurs secondary to delayed arterial healing and local hypersensitivity reactions which may be related to the drug, the polymer, or both. (2). Virmani et al (3) reported that patients who died of late stent thrombosis 18 months after sirolimus-eluting stent (SES) implantation showed a severe localized hypersensitivity reaction that involved the whole vessel wall and this reaction may be caused by polymer or from the drug-release kinetics of SES. It is known from preclinical and clinical studies that, nonabsorbable polymer can induce persistent inflammation which may lead to delayed cellular proliferation and 'late catch-up' restenosis (4). Early (ie first) generation DES consisted of a metal stent for vessel scaffolding, cytotoxic drug for neointimal growth inhibition and a polymer coating to improve the biocompatibility of the stents or as a vehicle to load drugs onto stents. Since polymers have been identified as a possible cause of late complications of DES, new stents are being designed to improve polymers' biocompatibility or to bond drugs on stents without polymers. Biodegradable polymers are likely to be safer than nonabsorbable polymers because inflammation will be eliminated after the polymer degrades. The BioFreedom drug coated stent (DCS) Coronary Stent Delivery System is comprised of three key components including 1) a 316 L stainless steel bare metal stent platform which has been modified with a proprietary surface treatment resulting in a selectively micro-structured, abluminal surface. The selectively micro-structured surface allows 2) Biolimus A9TM (drug) adhesion to the abluminal surface of the stent without the use of a polymer or binder. The drug-coated stent is crimped onto 3) a delivery system which includes a high pressure, semi-compliant balloon incorporated onto the distal tip of a rapid exchange delivery catheter system. The delivery system has two radiopaque markers inside the balloon, which fluoroscopically mark the ends of the stent to facilitate proper stent placement. Biolimus A9 is the therapeutic agent used in the BioFreedom DCS. Biolimus A9 is a proprietary semi-synthetic sirolimus derivative. It is highly lipophilic, rapidly absorbed in tissues, and able to reversibly inhibit growth factor-stimulated cell proliferation. Current data suggest that Biolimus A9, on a molecular level, forms a complex with the cytoplasmic proteins that inhibit the cell cycle between the G0 and G1 phase. The result is an interruption of the cascade governing cell reproduction, growth, and proliferation. Related pharmaceuticals, sirolimus and everolimus, are well tolerated cytostatic immunosuppressive agents with predictable and similar adverse event profiles. Biolimus A9 is closely related chemically to both sirolimus and everolimus. Based on administration in healthy volunteers, Biolimus A9 has been shown to have a very similar adverse event profile to these other two drugs when used at equivalent dose levels., Biolimus A9 easily crosses the cell membrane to achieve therapeutic effects in target smooth muscle cells and, compared with the sirolimus-eluting Cypher stent (SES), the high lipophilicity of BA9 leads to relatively low systemic exposure.(5) Furthermore, the drug coating is applied only to the abluminal surface of the stent, allowing the drug release to be directed almost entirely into the vessel wall where it targets the smooth muscle cells injured by the angioplasty procedure. On the other hand, there is little drug release on the luminal surfaces of the stent, thus there is less inhibition of endothelial cells which need to grow on the inside of the stent in order for healing to occur. Animal studies have shown the Biofreedom stent demonstrates equivalent or less early and late reduction of intimal smooth muscle cell proliferation compared with the Cypher Sirolimus-eluting stent (SES) in a porcine model. After implantation of BioFreedom stent, delayed arterial healing has been shown to be minimal, and there was no increased inflammation at 180 days compared with SES implantation (6). Pharmacokinetic and tissue concentration analyses showed that there was no high early peaking of Biolimus A9 level in blood (6). On-going studies of Biofreedom in humans showed non-inferiority of in-stent late lumen loss at 12 months versus paclitaxel eluting stents (PES) (7). This current EGO BIOFREEDOM study protocol is designed based on the approved protocols of the EGO Study and EGO-COMBO Study, which were both successfully completed. We aim to focus mainly on the time frame, degree of endothelialization, and the subsequent neointimal proliferation after BioFreedom stent implantation, as assessed by the state-of-the-art intracoronary imaging - optical coherence tomography (OCT), which has been used extensively in the completed EGO and EGO-COMBO study. Indeed, intracoronary optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a simple catheter-based imaging technique using optic fibre to achieve very detailed assessment (resolution down to 100 microns) in intra-coronary stent apposition, early stent coverage (endothelialization) and late stent neoinitmal growth (restenosis). It is performed as part of routine cardiac catheterization procedure and provides high-resolution cross sectional images of the coronary arteries. OCT has been shown to be safe in clinical practice (8). The LightLab C7XR OCT system (Frequency Domain OCT) is a commercial available product with CE Mark and FDA approval, which has been used in the EGO Studies. The OCT catheter is a non-occlusive optic fibre which is extremely small and flexible. It poses no additional risk to the patient other than those inherent risks of a standard angioplasty procedure.\",\n",

       "  'CTOs are common among patients with angina, and are detected in around 20% of patients undergoing coronary angiography. Treatment of CTO has been found to constitute only 7% of PCI practice on average. One of the reasons for the under-presentation of CTOs in PCI target lesions is the lack of evidence-based medical data on treatment indications, and the continued low level of accepted evidence for the treatment of CTOs by PCI in PCI guidelines. Patients with a CTO represent patients with stable coronary artery disease. The COURAGE trial comparing PCI with optimal medical therapy in stable coronary disease did not show a difference in mortality or myocardial infarction between the two treatment options. However, CTOs were not included in the COURAGE trial. But that trial did confirm the superiority of PCI over OMT in controlling symptoms of angina, with a high cross-over rate to PCI. Whether PCI for CTO is superior to OMT in reducing MACE in those patients with a large ischaemic burden has never been tested in a randomized controlled trial. While there is compelling evidence from registry studies of a clinical and prognostic benefit following successful PCI of CTO compared with PCI failure, there has been no randomized controlled trial of contemporary PCI using drug-eluting stents versus optimal medical therapy. The COURAGE trial nuclear sub-study confirms both that prognosis is closely related to the extent of residual ischaemia and that PCI is more effective in reducing residual ischaemia than optimal medical therapy alone. This confirms earlier retrospective data suggesting that the benefit of PCI is greatest in patients with moderate (10-20%) or severe (>20%) ischaemia.

       "  'Drug eluting balloons (DEB) have been developed to overcome the limitations of drug eluting stent (DES), but clinical results of different studies about DEB are not consistent. Thus, we performed a meta-analysis to compare outcomes of DEB and DES in coronary artery disease (CAD). The meta-analysis was performed according to the recommended methods [14-15]. A systematic search for eligible studies involved MEDLINE, CENTRAL, Embase, Highwire Press, Scopus and Google Scholar databases and was conducted without language restriction by two independent investigators (A.L. and A.R.), using the following keywords: \"drug\", \"eluting\" \"balloon(s)\", \"DEB\", \"coronary\", \"angioplasty\". Divergences were resolved by consensus. Endnote software v. 10 was used to build up libraries of results that were combined after erasing duplicates. The references of retrieved studies were searched manually for additional trials, and efforts to contact authors were performed to obtain further study details or additional references. The search is updated to December 2012. Selection criteria: citations were screened at title and abstract level and retrieved as full reports. - Inclusion criteria were: 1) randomized studies or cohort studies reporting a comparison between a DEB treated group and a DES treated group; 2) availability of reports of late lumen loss (LLL) and/or overall death and/or myocardial infarction (MI) and/or stent thrombosis (ST) and/or target lesion revascularization (TLR). - Exclusion criteria were: 1) duplicate reporting (in which case the manuscript reporting the largest sample or the longest follow-up was selected), 2) follow up of at least 6 months; 3) studies presenting composite major adverse cardiac events (MACE) without mentioning individual end points. Data were abstracted on pre-specified forms by 2 unblinded reviewers; divergences were resolved by consensus. Internal validity : the present meta-analysis was performed according to the Guidelines for randomized controlled trials of the Cochrane Collaboration and for non randomized studies in compliance with the Guidelines of the MOOSE group. Quality of included studies was appraised by 2 unblinded investigators. The risk of selection, performance, detection, and attrition bias (expressed as low risk of bias [A], moderate risk of bias [B], high risk of bias [C], or incomplete reporting leading to inability to ensure the underlying risk of bias [D]) were evaluated separately, as recommended. Non-randomized studies were evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale a validated technique in assessing the quality of non-randomized studies. Data analysis and synthesis: Odds ratios (ORs) were computed from individual studies and pooled according to a fixed effect (e.g. inverse variance weighting) or random effect model in case of statistical heterogeneity. Two separate subgroup analysis were pre-specified: 1) exclusion of studies with small vessel and bifurcation PCI; 2) exclusion of non-randomized studies 3) exclusion of studies in which DEBs were not used together with BMS deployment. Results will be presented as overall meta-analysis and subgroups meta-analyses for DEB vs DES comparisons. Outcomes appraised were in-stent LLL, overall death, MI, ST and TLR. We used the Mantel-Haenszel method for combining ORs, a validated method to pool the data in a meta-analysis of binary outcomes. For the in-stent LLL outcome, the mean difference of 6-month LLL compared with baseline was used and the overall weighted mean difference (WMD) was built with the inverse variance method. Heterogeneity was assessed by Cochran\\'s Q test, with 2-tailed p=0.1. Statistical inconsistency test (I2) was also employed to overcome the low statistical power of Cochran\\'s Q test. The potential publication bias was examined by constructing a \"funnel plot\", in which sample size was plotted against odds ratios. In addition, a mathematical estimate of the asymmetry of this plot was provided by a linear regression approach. Asymmetry was considered to be present if the intercept of the regression line did deviate significantly from zero. To explore and mitigate heterogeneity, pre-specified covariates (prevalence of diabetes in the study population and reference coronary vessel diameter) as potential confounders were considered in the meta-regression analysis. Pooling of data, subgroup analyses and publication bias tests were performed with Review Manager 5.1 (The Nordic Cochrane Center, Købehvn, Denmark) and StatsDirect v 2.7.8 (StatsDirect Ltd, Cheshire WA, UK). Meta-regression analyses were builded with Comprehensive Meta-analysis Version 2 (Biostat, Englewood, New Jersey, United States).',\n",

       "  'Introduction: This is a phase II study evaluating the treatment adherence rate, efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with capecitabine, oxaliplatin and irinotecan (CAPOXIRI) in patients with resectable (able to be cut out), borderline resectable and locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Neoadjuvant CAPOXIRI chemotherapy is an innovative strategy that builds on the advancement associated with oxaliplatin, irinotecan, fluorouracil, and folinate (FOLFIRINOX regimen) chemotherapy in patients with metastatic disease. Building on the FOLFIRINOX regimen the use of CAPOXIRI is among the most clinically relevant projects for patients diagnosed with earlier stage pancreatic adenocarcinoma with the goal of improving patient outcomes and advancing our knowledge and understanding of this devastating disease. The primary end point is the treatment adherence rate (TAR) which is the percentage of patients who complete 75% of the planned treatment (dose) for their diagnostic strata (resectable disease and borderline resectable/locally advanced disease). Secondary end points are: Overall survival (OS), Disease-free survival (DFS; for those patients who are rendered disease-free by surgical resection), Progression Free Survival (PFS), Response Rate (RR), toxicity, and R0 resection rate (for patients stratified as having resectable disease and borderline resectable disease). Background and Study Rationale: It is estimated that 36,800 people will die of pancreatic cancer in the United States in 2010. Surgical resection offers the only chance of cure, but only 15-20% of cases are potentially resectable at present. Furthermore, prognosis is poor, even for those undergoing complete resection. Reported five-year survival rates following pancreatic-duodenectomy (surgery of the small intestine and pancreas) for node-negative disease is 25-30% and for node-positive disease is 10%. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of the combination of capecitabine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan (CAPOXIRI) on the disease. This research is being done because we think that this combination, CAPOXIRI, may be better than other combinations used to treat your stage of pancreatic cancer. A research study like this one has been done which shows that a similar combination of drugs including oxaliplatin, irinotecan and 5-fluorouracil (which is in the same class as capecitabine) can be effective in treating patients with pancreatic cancer who have more advanced disease than you. All of the drugs that are being used in this study have been approved by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration).',\n",

This study will target individuals who are either known to have a disease-causing mutation or who are at risk for such a mutation (the child or sibling of a proband with a known mutation) and unaware of their genetic status. Because the age at onset of cognitive changes is relatively consistent within each family and with each mutation (Ryman et al., 2014), an age at onset is determined for each affected parent or mutation. This study will enroll subjects who are either asymptomatic and are within a specific window of time of expected age of onset for their family and/or mutation or who have symptoms of mild Alzheimer\\'s disease. The ability to identify individuals destined to develop Alzheimer\\'s disease (AD) within the next 10-15 years with a high degree of confidence provides a unique opportunity to assess the efficacy of therapies at asymptomatic and very early stages of dementia. Although there are differences between dominantly inherited AD and the more common age-associated sporadic disease, the results of the early intervention in this study will have implications for future studies and treatments in sporadic AD. Families with known disease-causing mutations are extremely rare and are geographically dispersed throughout the world. These constraints necessitate a specialized study design. Many of the subjects in this study will not yet have any cognitive symptoms of AD; they will be \"asymptomatic\" carriers of mutations that cause Autosomal Dominant Alzheimer\\'s disease and would be expected to perform normally on standard cognitive and functional testing. Imaging and fluid biomarkers will be used to demonstrate that the treatment compounds have engaged their therapeutic targets. A set of cognitive measures designed to assess the very earliest and most subtle cognitive changes will be collected. Additionally, because many at-risk individuals decide not to know whether they have the disease-associated mutation or not, some of the at-risk individuals enrolled in this study will not have the disease causing mutations; they will be \"mutation negative\". It is important to enroll non-carrier subjects to avoid coercion (e.g., potential subjects may be pressured into genetic testing to learn their genetic status in order to be eligible for the trial). These mutation negative individuals will be assigned to the placebo group; subjects and site study staff will remain blinded as to these individuals\\' active or placebo group assignment and mutation status. Thus, the study will be double blinded for placebo and for mutation status, except for mutation positive subjects who are aware of their genetic status. Two different therapies will be tested in order to increase the likelihood that an effective treatment will be discovered. They were selected for this trial based on mechanism of action and available data on efficacy and safety profile. The study design includes a pooled placebo arm shared by all treatment groups. Mutation positive subjects will be randomized to one of the four study arms (gantenerumab:gantenerumab placebo:solanezumab:solanezumab placebo) in an overall 3:1:3:1 ratio for active drug:placebo. Mutation negative subjects will all receive placebo. Importantly, subjects and study staff will not be blinded as to which treatment group each subject has been assigned; they will be blinded as to whether subjects have been randomized to active drug or placebo arms. Biomarker data will be analyzed for prespecified endpoints consistent with the drug\\'s mechanism of action and known effects on the tested biomarkers. The primary cognitive endpoint will be the same for both treatment arms. Interim analyses of the imaging or fluid biomarker endpoint will assess safety and whether each study drug engages its biological targets. This biomarker approach is particularly important in this study as most study subjects will be cognitively normal at the time of enrollment and most will remain cognitively normal during the first 2 years of the study. The cognitive composite is designed to assess subtle cognitive changes that may be detectable before the onset of dementia. The four year cognitive endpoint will allow for analysis of these subtle cognitive changes.',\n",

       "  \"Patients with moderate to advanced COPD are known to have static hyperinflation (at rest) as a consequence of expiratory flow limitation. Hyperinflation is easily detected by measuring lung volumes during standard pulmonary function testing. Decreased Inspiratory Capacity (IC) secondary to hyperinflation has been described as a predictor of mortality in COPD, and as a limiting factor for the maximal tidal volume attained during exercise. Hyperinflation has been linked to a low cardiac output in part by limiting left ventricular ejection fraction during exercise. Treatment with inhaled anticholinergic agents or long-acting beta agonists (LABA) and combination of the LABA formoterol and budesonide has been shown to improve IC and decrease lung hyperinflation. Bronchodilators have been shown to improve exercise endurance in COPD when combined with pulmonary rehabilitation, however the exact mechanism: improvement of lung mechanics and /or improvement in cardiac function is not well known. Impedance cardiography (ICG) has emerged as a method to measure cardiac output without the need for invasive devices. Cardiac output measurement by impedance cardiography (CO-ICG) is a valid and reproducible method. It has been shown to have good correlation with thermodilution and the direct Fick method for the measurement of stroke volume and cardiac output. In addition, the oxygen pulse, easily obtained by dividing the measured oxygen uptake by the heart rate (VO2/HR) provides an adequate reflection of cardiac stroke volume when the systemic extraction of oxygen is stable. This method has been used to evaluate the effect of static and dynamic hyperinflation on cardiac function. This pilot study is designed to be a single center (Brigham and Women's Hospital), randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind, crossover study of 14 patients (male and female 40 to 80 years old) with COPD and static hyperinflation. The primary endpoint is the measurement of stroke volume, cardiac output and oxygen pulse at rest before and after the administration of budesonide/formoterol compared to placebo.\",\n",

       "  'Background: Dexmedetomidine, a highly selective arfa2-adrenergic agonist, is known to be a unique sedative agent which causes less acute tolerance, drug addiction and withdrawal compared with gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA) agonists. Dexmedetomidine was approved for short-term ICU sedation in 2004 in Japan, and it has been used particularly for surgical ICU patients. In August 2010 dexmedetomidine was approved in Japan for sedation lasting more than 24 hours. Recent evidence demonstrated that dexmedetomidine has organ protective effects including neuroprotection, cardioprotection, renal protection, gastrointestinal tract action, and anti-inflammatory action. Dexmedetomidine was shown to significantly decrease the infarct size in isolated rat hearts. Additionally, dexmedetomidine exhibited a preconditioning effect against ischemic injury in hippocampal slices, and this result was considered an apoptosis suppression effect of dexmedetomidine. Aydin C et al reported that dexmedetomidine enhanced the spontaneous contractions of the ileum in peritonitis rats compared with propofol and midazolam. Taniguchi and colleagues demonstrated that dexmedetomidine reduced high mortality rates and the plasma cytokine concentrations, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha in endotoxemic rats. A meta-analysis has shown that perioperative alfa2-adrenergic agonists, including dexmedetomidine infusion, decreased cardiovascular events on patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Dexmedetomidine treated patients undergoing thoracotomy indicated increase in urine output, reduction in serum creatinine, and the suppression of diuretics in a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind study. Septic patients receiving dexmedetomidine had improved 28-day mortality rates compared with septic patients receiving lorazepam in a sub-group analysis of MENDS randomized controlled trial. These positive effects of dexmedetomidine on the cardiovascular system, neurons, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract action, and an anti-inflammatory action, are expected to improve mortality in septic patients. However, large clinical research studies have not been conducted yet. We designed and conducted the DESIRE trial (DExmedetomidine for Sepsis in ICU Randomized Evaluation trial) to test a hypothesis that dexmedetomidine may improve clinical outcome and has these organ protective effects on septic patients. Objective: To determine whether dexmedetomidine improves clinical outcome and has organ protective effects on septic patients.',\n",

Objective: The aim of our study is to examine the outcome of cow's milk allergic patients who incorporated baked milk products into their diets. In order to recruit a large population, a multicenter study across many hospital related allergy clinics in Israel will be conducted. Methods Participants The study protocol is essentially as described previously (12). Subjects will be recruited from the relevant allergy clinics involved in this project. The study will be approved by the local Institutional Review Board, and informed consent will be obtained. Eligible subjects will be aged 1 to 18 years, had positive skin prick test (SPT) responses or detectable serum milk-specific IgE, and had a history of an allergic reaction to milk within 6 months before study entry or milk-specific IgE levels or SPT responses greater than 95% of predicted value for clinical reactivity (if <2 years old, a level >5 kUA/L; if >2 years old, a level >15 kUA/L; SPT mean wheal diameter, >8 mm.

Design Active group - Based on the results of the initial baked milk oral challenge, subjects will be categorized as baked milk reactive or baked milk tolerant (group I and II, respectively). Group I subjects will be instructed to completely avoid all forms of milk but will be offered a repeat challenge 6 or more months from the initial challenge. Group II subjects will be instructed to incorporate baked milk products daily into their diets and after 6 or more months will be offered challenges to baked cheese products (pizza). Similarly, after 6 or more months, baked cheese-tolerant children will be offered challenges to unheated milk. The two groups will be followed at least 2 years and the outcome as well as other parameters (accidental exposure, use of medication, quality of life, appearance of related symptoms, ect) will be compared between the 2 groups. Baked milk - Each muffin (or the equivalent piece of cake) contains ~ 1.3 g of milk protein. The muffins/cake will be prepared according to instructed recipe and will be baked at 180 degree C for 30 minutes. Baked milk-tolerant subjects will be instructed to ingest 1 to 3 servings per day of store-bought baked milk products with milk listed as a minor ingredient (third or less) or home-baked products with an equivalent amount of milk protein. Baked cheese - Cheese pizza (Maadanot), will be baked at 2200 C for 13 minutes or longer. Baked cheese-tolerant subjects will be instructed to eat any brand of well-cooked cheese pizza 4 to 7 times weekly and limited to 1 daily serving. Unheated milk - Challenges will be performed with skim milk totaling 240 mL (or other product containing 8-10 g of unheated milk protein, such as yogurt). Follow-up allergy evaluations - Blood and serum samples will be collected for the measurement of IgE and IgG4 antibodies to milk, casein, and b-lactoglobulin by using UniCAP (Phadia, Uppsala, Sweden) as well as for T cell analyses.

Data collection The HRQoL will be monitored in a prospective, longitudinal study (QUESTION65). A minimum of 200 patients will be included and the inclusion period is estimated to 2-3 years. All patients give informed consent when entering the study. In addition, all patients have signed an informed consent when included in the Norwegian Renal Registry which allows the use of unidentified data from the registry in research protocols. HRQoL will be assessed using the KDQOL-SF-36 health Survey. This survey consists of two parts, a generic and disease specific part. The same questionnaire is used before and after transplantation. For improved evaluation of HRQoL data on response shift will be captured through questions related to personal preferences, values and internal standards. The result gathered will also be compared with data from an age matched Norwegian cohort. All patients over the age of 65 who are accepted for the kidney transplantation waiting list or living donor transplantation will receive an invitation to be included in the study. A new form will be distributed to included patients with intervals of six months until they are transplanted, permanently removed from the transplant waiting list or until death. Patients who are transplanted will receive a form at discharge from Rikshospitalet (10 weeks after transplantation), after six months and at one year. Aim 2: Explore the expectations of older kidney transplant candidates prior to transplantation and one year after transplantation. Data Collection: For the qualitative evaluation, 15-20 patients in dialysis will be included and a qualitative individual in-depth interview will be performed approximately one month after baseline HRQoL and repeated one year after transplantation. Selection will be made according to age and gender. Inclusion will continue until saturation is reached. Convenient variation and broadness in information will be secured in the sample. To secure shared decision making, patients will be invited to discuss the interview guide and design of the qualitative evaluation. Furthermore, the interview guide will be tested in a pilot study. An interview-manual will be used and PhD Andersen has considerable clinical experience within the field. We believe the results from the qualitative interviews also can be used to gain an improved understanding of the answers in the survey. Aim 3: Investigate the relationship between pre-transplant comorbidity, described by the Liu comorbidity index and post-operative complications, post-transplant 1 year survival and HRQoL. Data collection From 2012 we have included pre-transplant data according to the Liu comorbidity index as part of the routine work up of candidates for kidney transplantation. Complete data describing patient and transplant characteristics, including the Liu comorbidity index will be extracted from the Norwegian Renal Registry. In addition post-transplant morbidity and mortality will be extracted from the Norwegian Renal Registry. The data will be exported from the registry without any identification except from a patient number. In case of missing data from the registry, data will be retrieved from the patient records at Oslo University Hospital HF, Rikshospitalet.

It (a) uses electronic health record (EHR) technology to deliver patient-specific clinical decision support (CDS) to providers at the point of care, (b) assesses the impact of this intervention on identification and clinical care of hypertension in adolescents, and (c) assesses the impact of the intervention on costs of care.',\n",
       "  'Hypertension (HT) during adolescence tracks into adulthood, contributing to adult cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. National guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension in children and adolescents were developed by the National High Blood Pressure Education Program (NHBPEP); their Fourth Report was published in 2004. Despite heightened awareness of hypertension in pediatric populations, most adolescents with elevated blood pressure remain clinically unrecognized. Factors that contribute to this gap in care include: the need to translate adolescent blood pressure (BP) measures into BP percentiles on the basis of age, gender, and height, lack of familiarity with NHBPEP clinical guidelines, and competing demands at clinical encounters. Electronic health record (EHR)-based clinical decision support (CDS) can be used to address these barriers and support better care of elevated BP and HT in adolescents. In this project, the investigators integrate EHR-extracted data with sophisticated Web-based CDS algorithms to provide patient-specific point-of-care clinical recommendations, in accordance with NHBPEP guidelines. To evaluate the impact of this innovation on quality and cost of care, the investigators randomize 18 clinics with their 130 pediatric care providers (PCP) and their estimated 17,000 adolescent patients to receive or not receive this EHR-based CDS intervention. The investigators hypothesize that the intervention will improve recognition and early management of elevated BP and that short-term increases in outpatient care costs will be offset by longer-term clinical benefits, estimated using established econometric models. This innovative project (a) addresses the under-recognized high-risk patient population of adolescents, (b) integrates EHR and Web-based CDS technology to provide sophisticated patient-specific point-of-care CDS, (c) develops and implements novel and intuitive visual interfaces to communicate CDS recommendations to PCPs, and (d) provides both clinical and cost outcome data useful to clinicians and policymakers. If the EHR-based CDS intervention improves adherence to NHBPEP recommendations, it will provide a much-needed tool to combat the burgeoning problem of rising cardiovascular risk factors in children and adolescents. Further, regardless of outcome, the technology that is developed and tested will provide many useful insights to advance the science of EHR-based CDS. This will, in turn, help translate the massive public and private investments in EHR technology into improved adolescent health outcomes.',\n",

       "  \"HFE-related hereditary hemochromatosis has a highly variable penetrance : 1% of homozygous women and 30% of homozygous men would develop a clinically expressed disease. No predictive phenotypic or genetic markers are available. The Iron Reabsorption Index (IRI), recently described by our group, correspond to the daily amount of reabsorbed iron for a subject whose iron stock is less than 50 µg / L and stabilized with maintenance phlebotomy. For one patient, the IRI is constant over time, probably related to the functional deficit underlying. Unfortunately, IRI is a retrospective marker requiring at least one year of treatment, which limits its practical interest and directs its use for research activity. We're looking for a more simple phenotypic marker readily available in clinical practice, which would predict at the time of diagnosis the evolution of the disease and therefore would better define the therapeutic options. The pathophysiology of hemochromatosis is a dysregulation of hepcidin synthesis. We assume that hepcidin / ferritin ratio could be a phenotypic marker like the IRI, stage disease independent and constant over time. Indeed H/F ratio may reflect the adaptability of hepcidin production regulation for a level of iron stock No data are available on the validated values of this ratio. The aim of the project is to determine the intra-individual variations of the H / F ratio over time during maintenance therapy and to assess the correlation with the IRI. The study involve 30 C282Y homozygous men, followed in a reference center with phlebotomy maintenance therapy and stabilized at a low level of ferritin (<50 µg / L) for at least 1 year. The intra-individual variation of H/F ration will be determine by 5 samples every 14 days for 8 weeks. The correlation with IRI will be validated externally by the iron load observed at diagnosis.

AIMS: Document the prevalence and severity of fibrosis in patients with different chronic liver disease (elevated liver enzymes) who are being followed up in the liver unit and to find associated factors with significant fibrosis and cirrhosis at ziv medical center, Safed,Bar Ilan University. Israel. METHODS: Fibro scan will be performed to all patients with abnormal liver enzymnes who attend the liver clinic. Liver stiffness measurement, age, gender, BMI, will be measured. Questionaire on soft drink consumption, Coffee drinking, use of herbs, and a history of cancer or heart disease will be distributed. Expected RESULTS: we expect that the liver stiffness (normal 1-6 Kpa) will be higher in NAFLD patients than in viral hepatitis patients for the same age ,same BMI, and the same duration of disease. More over, we expect serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) values will emerge as the most important independent predictive variable of fibrosis and not serum ALT. A significant correlations between soft drink and coffee consumption with the extent of liver fibrosis is also expected. CONCLUSIONS: This prospective study will confirm that screening patients with elevated liver enzymes is beneficial and detect earlier the presence of liver fibrosis mainly in patients with NAFLD.',\n",

       "  \"The purpose of this study is to investigate the impacts of home-based couple HIV-testing and counseling and male partner education on partner HIV testing and other critical maternal and infant health outcomes during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Additionally, the study seeks to assess the cost-effectiveness of this approach. Involvement of men during the antenatal and postpartum period, including HIV testing of male partners, can have substantial benefits for women and infants. In observational studies, male participation in antenatal care has been associated with increased uptake of prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) interventions, and more recently, a study in Kenya found a significant HIV-free survival benefit for children of HIV-infected women whose male partners attended antenatal care where couple HIV testing was offered. In this study only 31% of ~450 men invited for counseling and testing came to clinic, highlighting the challenges faced across sub-Saharan Africa when trying to access male partners of pregnant women. In areas of high HIV-1 prevalence, high levels of male involvement may be readily achievable because home-based counseling and testing is highly acceptable and the benefits of male participation and HIV testing extend to HIV-uninfected pregnant and postpartum women and infants. Reaching out to men during pregnancy may reduce incident HIV infection and vertical transmission among these women, but efforts to engage men in antenatal care in Western Kenya have thus far achieved limited success. This intervention may achieve gains beyond prevention of maternal and infant HIV-1 acquisition through identification of HIV-infected men who would otherwise not learn their status or delay treatment, and by improving child health through targeted education of male partners. When administered in a home-based setting simple, established interventions such as the promotion of exclusive breastfeeding have been shown to be associated with significant reductions in child mortality. Home-based approaches also lend themselves to integration with targeted interventions such as promotion of HIV testing among male partners of at-risk pregnant women. Furthermore, a successful HIV testing program for male partners of pregnant women has potential to reach a large number of men who may be unaware of their HIV status or who are HIV-infected but not in care, providing linkages to treatment clinics and promoting prevention interventions, such as safe sex and voluntary male circumcision for those who are uninfected. In this randomized clinical trial up to 600 couples (300 in each treatment arm) will be randomized to standard antenatal care or home-based partner education and HIV testing (HOPE) as part of routine pregnancy services. Women will be enrolled at the antenatal clinic in Kisumu District Hospital, Kisumu, Kenya. Couples in the control group will receive the HOPE Intervention, featuring home-based couple counseling and HIV testing as well as key educational messages concerning HIV prevention behaviors, facility delivery, exclusive breastfeeding, and post-partum family planning. Women in the control arm will be invited to bring their male partners to the antenatal clinic for voluntary clinic testing and counseling. Women will be followed up at clinic visits 6-weeks and 14-weeks postpartum and again with their male partner 6-months post-partum. These follow-up visits will include questionnaires to measure uptake of HIV testing, facility delivery, exclusive breastfeeding and postpartum contraceptive use as well as linkage to HIV care. Cost-effectiveness of the intervention will also be evaluated in order to inform future scale-up. First, the investigators hypothesize that successful implementation of HOPE will result in higher uptake of male partner HIV testing, couple testing and disclosure of HIV status. The investigators also hypothesize that there will be benefits to HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected women and their children who will have improved uptake of interventions to improve maternal and child health. Specifically, the investigators anticipate higher levels of facility delivery, optimal breastfeeding practices, and post-partum contraceptive use, as well as increased uptake of antiretroviral treatment for HIV+ women in the intervention arm, relative to the control arm. Second, the investigators hypothesize that greater than 85% of HIV-1-infected men identified through home-based partner education and testing (HOPE) will access care and treatment services, and, overall, more women in the HOPE arm will know their partners' status at each time point and more partners will be in care and treatment. Third, the investigators predict that uptake of counseling and testing and HIV prevalence among male partners and family members will be high enough to make this approach cost-effective from both payer and societal perspectives.\",\n",
       "  \"1. Study design: The proposed study is a randomized clinical trial to determine the effect of offering home-based partner education and testing (HOPE) to pregnant women. Up to 600 women will be enrolled and randomly assigned to the HOPE intervention (home-based partner education and testing - HOPE) and INVITE arms (clinic invitation to male partner to attend couple HIV counseling and testing). Women will be recruited into the study when they present for routine antenatal care. 2. Study Area Description: This proposed trial will be carried out in and around Kisumu, located in Western Kenya, in collaboration with Kisumu District (now County) Hospital. This site has been selected because it has a high volume of new antenatal visits (~200/month), and high HIV prevalence among women presenting for antenatal care (~9.5-12%), which correlates with high HIV-1 incidence in this population. This will enable us to achieve the necessary number of outcome events in the desired timeframe. Kisumu District Hospital provides HIV testing to women and couples and offers PMTCT interventions to pregnant and postpartum HIV-1-infected women according to the Kenya Ministry of Health guidelines, which include ART when indicated. The facility adheres to the Kenyan national infant feeding policy and provides infant feeding counseling for pregnant and lactating women and their partners, emphasizing the benefits of breastfeeding and advocating for exclusive breastfeeding during infants first 6 months of life. 3. Sample Method: Women will be recruited at the antenatal clinic at Kisumu District Hospital. All consenting women who report for care at the clinic will be screened, and all who are eligible will be invited to participate (continuous enrollment). 4. Recruitment: Women will present to the antenatal clinic at Kisumu District Hospital, at which point they will be introduced to the study by study nurses and verbally asked for permission to be screened for eligibility. (A waiver of written consent is requested for screening.) Women who agree will be screened for eligibility, and eligible women will be invited to complete the consent process and provide written consent as a prerequisite for participation in the study. Scripts regarding information about the study and invitation to the study, which will be used by study nurses, are included in the screening forms, found in the appendix. Male partners will be approached at a home locator visit (a telephone call will be made if the man is not present), at which point the study's health advisors will introduce the study to the men. Men will be asked for permission to be screened for eligibility (waiver of written consent). Men who agree will be screened for eligibility and eligible men will be invited to the study and go through the consent process (written consent). Scripts regarding information about the study and invitation to the study, which will be used by study health advisors, as well as home visit and telephone contact protocols are included in the enrollment forms, found in the appendix. It is expected that some men will decline participation, and, although male partner participation is an important component of the study, male enrollment is not a prerequisite for the enrollment and continued participation of their female partners. 5. Enrollment: Eligible women recruited at the Kisumu District Hospital Antenatal Clinic will be invited to the study and go through the consent process (written consent). Women will be invited to enroll the same day as they are screened. However, those who desire more time to consider their potential participation will be offered the option of returning the next day to enroll in the study. Once enrolled, women will be interviewed with a standardized questionnaire and tested for HIV using a HIV-1 rapid test. All women will have a home visit to verify and record the location of their home using GPS technology within 1 week of enrollment, as this will help to ensure follow-up in later stages of the study. 6. Randomization: This study is a randomized clinical trial. At the end of the enrollment visit, women will be randomized to the HOPE treatment or the INVITE arm based on computer-generated block randomization. 7. Consent Procedure: During screening, women will be asked for verbal consent during the screening process, and they will be presented with a consent form and asked for written consent at their enrollment visit. Men will be offered the consent form during the home visit or HOPE intervention. Participants can opt out of the study at any time. 8. Data Collection Procedure: A. Basic details: Women in both study arms will have a clinic enrollment visit, two clinic visits postpartum at 6 and 14 weeks which correspond with childhood immunization visits, and a home visit at 6 months postpartum. Participants will be reimbursed at 300 Kenyan shillings per clinic visit and 200 Kenyan shillings per home visits. Irrespective of treatment status (i.e. standard ANC or HOPE arm), women will receive a home visit for tracing and retention purposes within 1 week of enrollment and one home visit at the end of follow-up when women are 6 months postpartum. Women in the intervention arm will have an additional home visit for home-based counseling and testing which will occur within 1-2 weeks of enrollment. Each of these visits is described below in more detail and outlined in the study design flowchart. B. Enrollment visit: In addition to provision of informed consent and randomization, women in both arms will be interviewed and examined. Peripheral blood specimens will be collected for HIV-1 rapid testing, and questions will be asked about demographic and socio-behavioral characteristics, medical, sexual, and reproductive history, and any recent or current symptoms. All women will then be asked to allow a counselor on the study team to accompany them home to confirm locator information for future tracing and retention efforts. C. Home visit: All women in the proposed study will have a home visit to confirm the physical location of the their home because written addresses are often unreliable. For our mother-to-child HIV transmission studies and HIV-discordant couple studies in Kenya, conducting a home visit on the day of enrollment or shortly thereafter has been highly acceptable and a critical component of an effective tracing and retention plan. Among HIV-discordant couples in Dr. Farquhar's recent prospective cohort study, uptake of the home visit was 97% and for pregnant HIV-infected women in Nairobi, the proportion agreeing to home visit also exceeded 95%. For this study, a written description of the physical location will be recorded by the counselor visiting the woman, and this will be incorporated into the woman's study file in addition to GPS coordinates, recorded using handheld devices that have been used successfully in Nairobi and other regions in Kenya by this research group. During the home visit, male partners of women randomized to the HOPE intervention will be asked to discuss their availability for the HOPE intervention when community health workers will next return. Alternatively, if the male partner is not at home, he will be contacted via phone or home visit to schedule a return visit. D. Intervention and control arm procedures: (See Interventions section) E. Postpartum follow-up visits: Three postpartum follow-up visits will occur in the clinic at 6 and 14 weeks postpartum when women return with their infants to receive routine immunizations and at 6 months postpartum at home. At these visits, women will complete a brief questionnaire, and blood will be drawn for rapid HIV testing at the 6-month visit. 9. Retention procedures: Retention and tracing will be high priorities in this study. By design, there are only two follow-up visits prior to the 6-month final visit because more frequent follow-up with rapid HIV testing of women could alter women's behavior and reduce the observed effect of the home-based partner education and testing (HOPE) intervention. To minimize loss to follow-up, study staff will perform home visits for participants in both treatment arms and ask for at least 3 phone numbers of people who could be contacted if the participant is not responding to calls. In past studies these two approaches have been extremely effective for tracing individuals and couples. Additionally, active tracing will begin two weeks after the missed visit, for any women not presenting for their visits at 6-weeks or 14-weeks postpartum. 10. Diagnosis and treatment of incident HIV-1 infection among women: For women who are initially HIV-seronegative, results of the 6-month rapid HIV tests will be provided as soon as they are available, and women with incident infection will be referred for initiation of antiretroviral treatment (ART). Study clinics and referral clinics will be educated about the importance of rapid initiation of ART when a woman is newly infected to promote immediate treatment. As a result of this education and given existing standard of care practices, sites will be prepared to provide ART at the study clinic and ensure that ART is initiated. When available, existing on-site PMTCT programs will be utilized to leverage PEPFAR and government resources and procure drugs for HIV-infected women at these sites. However, since national supplies may be inconsistent, the study team is prepared to supplement these stocks. 11. Diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of HIV-1 infection in male partners: In the regions surrounding Kisumu HIV-1 seroprevalence among women is estimated to be between 10-15%. Assuming a fairly substantial level of male participation (>75%), investigators anticipate diagnosing upwards of 25 men with HIV infection during the partner testing intervention. These men will be referred to the nearest Comprehensive Care Clinic (CCC) for CD4 testing, HIV care, and ART if indicated. For Aim 3, uptake of HIV care and treatment services among men testing HIV-seropositive during home-based testing will be measured using self-reports from the home visit at 6 months postpartum. A questionnaire will be used to assess the following outcomes: 1) presentation to the CCC for counseling, 2) initiation of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 3) acceptance of CD4 testing, and 4) ART initiation among those men who are eligible. While the study clinic does not anticipate needing to provide ART for these men, efforts will be made to ensure rapid uptake of ART by men identified as being at high-risk for transmitting HIV-1 to their female partners. The clinic will provide ART if necessary to bridge periods when medications are not available. 12. Provision of services for intimate partner violence: While there does not appear to be an increased risk of intimate partner violence (IPV) associated with HIV testing, IPV is common among women in Africa and was considered in the design and implementation of this study. Investigators will monitor IPV by measuring it at enrollment and at each follow-up visit. Women reporting IPV will be encouraged to utilize counseling and education services, and counselors will be made available. 13. Laboratory procedures: Infant filter paper assays will be performed on-site in the Kisumu KEMRI/CDC Laboratory which is located in close proximity to the study clinic. Study motorcycles will be used to transport specimens. HIV-1 rapid testing will be performed as part of routine care provided in the study clinics. Current protocols in the Kenyan national Voluntary Counseling and Testing (VCT) guidelines specify use of two commercial kits that are locally available, the Determine® HIV-1/2 Rapid Test (Abbott Laboratories) and the Uni-GoldTM Recombigen HIV Test (Trinity Biotech). Infant filter paper specimens will be assayed for HIV-1 DNA using PCR at the Kisumu KEMRI/CDC Laboratory following established protocols and Kenya national guidelines for infant testing.\",\n",

       "  'Vitamin D is an essential nutrient and pro-hormone that has garnered widespread attention over the past decade for both its known and theorized health benefits. Patients, clinicians and researchers have all been alerted to the increasing prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (defined as level of 25(OH)D <20 ng/mL) and the significance of the extra-skeletal health effects of vitamin D. Aside from the skeletal impacts of Vitamin D, there has been recent evidence about potential health benefits of vitamin D related to the multiple extra-skeletal roles of this hormone. In fact, vitamin D receptors are found in many organs including brain, heart, skin, small intestine, gonads, prostate and breast as well in almost all nucleated cells including osteoblasts, activated T and B-lymphocytes, and B islet cells. Studies in children and adolescents as well as in adults show associations of vitamin D deficiency with cardiovascular risk factors, musculoskeletal health, asthma, and autoimmune diseases. While Vitamin D deficiency is quite prevalent, adolescents who are obese or who are darker skinned are consistently shown to have higher rates of vitamin D deficiency than lean and lighter skinned adolescents. Treatment of vitamin D deficiency and maintenance of sufficient levels in adolescents are largely under-studied leaving patients and clinicians without clear evidence-based guidelines to follow. The goal of this study is to compare the efficacy of different treatment regimens for vitamin D deficiency in our population of predominantly minority adolescents and to examine the effect of correction of vitamin D deficiency on selected extra-skeletal targets of vitamin D action including musculoskeletal, cardiometabolic, and immune function.',\n",

White adipose tissue-related diseases are numerous, spreading from excess (obesity) to a complete (lipoatrophies) or partial lack (lipodystrophies), these 3 different disorders being paradoxically able to induce a metabolic insulin resistance syndrome. Among the involved cytokines, interleukin-7 (IL-7), mostly known for its immune functions, also participates to the quantitative and qualitative balance of fat mass. Thus, IL-7 over-expression in an animal model induces a lipodystrophic syndrome with insulin resistance whereas in humans, a preliminary study shows that LMNA-linked lipodystrophies are associated with an increase of blood IL-7 levels. IL-7 also participates to reactivation of autoimmunity in patients suffering from auto-immune type 1 after islet transplantation. Therefore, the aim of this study is to assess different cytokines, especially interleukin 7, and metabolic parameters levels as well as fat mass distribution, in different models of fat distribution, including normal-weighed, obese and lipodystrophic patients. A plasma serum, gene and tissue bank will be constituted in order to improve our knowledge in disorders linking fat mass, insulin resistance and immunity, especially in lipodystrophies, a rare monogenic model of insulin resistance. Patients: The included patients correspond to subjects of either normal body weight, or obese, or suffering from lipodystrophic syndrome, whatever their type 2 diabetes status. Methods: Blood IL-7 levels, other immune and/or pro-inflammatory cytokines, lymphocytes immuno-phenotype as well as metabolic parameters will be characterized. Fat mass will be assessed with non-invasive methods (DEXA and RMN). A plasma, serum and gene bank will be constituted. As well as an adipose tissue bank in patients who will have a surgery (especially plastic surgery in lipodystrophic patients), in order to cryo-preserve it and to define the inflammatory status of this tissue thanks to histological and molecular analysis. Main judgment criteria: The main judgment criteria will be IL-7 blood levels in the different groups according to fat mass and metabolic parameters. The hypothesis is that in humans the quantitative and /or qualitative disturbances of adipose tissue are associated with an increase of IL-7 levels and the development of insulin-resistance. Awaited results and possible implications: this study will allow to better delineate the immune and inflammatory component associated with alterations of fat mass distribution and glucose metabolism. Our approach combining clinical investigation and ex vivo and laboratory analysis is original and should allow to better understand the cellular mechanisms responsible for the inflammatory process originated in white adipose tissue and accompanying the disorders of this tissue- more especially lipodystrophic syndromes - opening new therapeutic perspectives in common human diseases (obesity, diabetes) on the one hand, and a rare disease (lipodystrophy) on the other hand.',\n",

       "  'Specific Aims Our study objective is to investigate if video peer modeling before the visit, plus immersive virtual reality during a preventive dental visit, reduces dental fear and uncooperative behaviors among children with ASD. SPECIFIC AIM: To pilot and test the feasibility and effectiveness of video peer modeling and immersive virtual reality in reducing dental fear among children with autism undergoing preventive dental visits. Methods: The investigators will enroll eighty (80) subjects aged 7-17 years with a known diagnosis of autism, who had a history of dental fear, per parental report. Study hypotheses: The primary hypotheses of interest are: (i) The mean change in the Venham Anxiety Score (VAS) over the 4 month period in children with ASD who receive the video intervention (Group B) is different from the mean change in the VAS over the 4-month period in children with ASD in the control group. (ii) The mean change in the VAS over the 4-month period in children with ASD who receive the immersive VR intervention (Group C) is different from the mean change in the VAS over the 4-month period in children with ASD in the control group. (iii) The mean change in the VAS over the 4-month period in children with ASD who receive the video intervention plus the immersive VR intervention (Group D) is different from the mean change in the VAS over the 4-month period in children with ASD in the control group. The secondary hypothesis is: (i) The mean change in the Venham Behavior Score over the 4-month period in children with ASD in Group D is different from the mean change in the Venham Behavior Score over the 4-month period in children with ASD in Group B or C.',\n",
       "  \"Dental care is a significant unmet health care need for children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Many children with ASD do not receive dental care because of fear associated with dental procedures; oftentimes they require general anesthesia for regular dental procedures, placing them at risk of associated complications. Many children with ASD have a strong preference for visual stimuli, particularly electronic screen media; this affinity has been utilized in their educational instruction. Objective: To determine if an innovative strategy using two types of electronic screen media was feasible and beneficial in reducing fear and uncooperative behaviors in children with ASD undergoing dental visits. Study procedures For this randomized control study, we will randomize participants into one of 4 groups: a) control group (Group A); b) video peer modeling only group (Group B); c) immersive VR only group (Group C) and d) video peer modeling plus immersive VR group (Group D). All enrolled children will have a pre-visit in the dental clinic, where they will receive usual care and baseline values of all parameters will be obtained. Medical records of all study children will be flagged so that they are identified upon arrival by the RA. In the exam room, the dental assistant will measure their pulse rate using a pulse oximeter. The dentist and RA will complete the Venham Anxiety and Behavioral Scale during the dental procedure for all study children. All study subjects will be scheduled to return for a follow up preventive dental visit in 4-6 months, which is the usual practice at CHB, depending on the child's oral health status. Children assigned to intervention Groups B and D will be mailed a copy of a DVD of the pre-recorded peer modeled visit 4 weeks before the scheduled return for the preventive dental visit. The parents will be asked to review the video with their child to orient them to all stages of the dental visit. In addition, children assigned to Group C and D will be given a virtual reality headset to watch movies or images during the dental visit. Children assigned to Group A (control group) will receive neither the DVD nor VR headset during the visit. We will repeat all measurements during the return visit for all study children. Participant randomization: Once we identify the entire sample of eligible subjects, we will generate a list of subjects that have enrolled for the study. With the assistance of the statistician, we will do a random allocation of each subject to Group A, B, C or D. Sample size calculation: In order to have an 80% chance of detecting a difference of 1 unit in either the mean change in the Venham anxiety score (VAS) over the 4-month period in children with ASD assigned to Group B, C or D, with the mean change in the VAS over the 4-month period in children with ASD in Group A, allowing for a 20% dropout rate, a total sample size of 80 children will be required. Subjects are being allocated equally between the 4 groups and each group will be randomly assigned 20 subjects. Data Analyses: After obtaining values of the Venham Anxiety and Behavior Scores for each group at baseline and 4 month period, the change in score will be calculated for each subject and a mean change in score and standard deviation generated for each group. WE will use a two-sided t-test to test each of these hypotheses. Bonferroni adjustments will be used to account for the multiple comparisons being carried out. The association of important covariates, such as the level of cognitive functioning, IQ, age, gender and number of hours of ABA received with the change in VAS will be modeled using linear regression analyses, with the outcome variable being the mean change in score for each subject. (A separate model will be fit for each outcome variable). Further analyses will include examining the association of pulse rate (a continuous outcome measure) with the covariates listed above. All analyses will be conducted by the study statistician and PI. Data Management Methods The RA will collect and manage all study data. We will enter personal information of study subjects obtained at enrollment in the study database. All subjects will be assigned codes which will be used throughout the study. No subject identifying personal information will be used to make up the study code for a specific patient. The link between the study-ID and medical record number will be kept in a locked/double password protected file. The Dr Isong and the RA will be the only ones who know the key/passwords. Data and Safety Monitoring Plan Every 6 months, all study data and protocols will be reviewed by the RA and PI to ensure that they confirm to written stipulations. Any missing data will be noted and collected. To prevent disclosure, information about participation and the results of the research will not be placed in the medical record. Study data will be coded and the key to the code kept in a separate locked file. All research data will be entered into a database. No names are entered into this database, only the codes assigned to the research record. All results will remain confidential. Only anonymized data will be shared among collaborators. Safety monitoring Risks associated with this study are expected to be minimal. Any report of risk or discomfort as a result of the study (please see below) experienced by study subjects will be documented and appropriate treatment and referrals will be provided. Subjects will be informed that they can dis-enroll from the study at any time if they experience any adverse effects.\",\n",

       "  'Numerous factors prevent consumers from making effective use of publicly reported information about the quality of health care, including limited recognition that quality of care varies between physicians, lack of awareness of the existing quality websites, limited internet access, and low health literacy and numeracy. In the proposed randomized controlled trial we will evaluate the impact of providing assistance for using and interpreting information about the quality of pediatric care on the Massachusetts Health Quality Partners Quality Insights website among a population of low income pregnant women. Results of the study will advance our understanding of effective strategies for overcoming barriers to using publicly reported information among vulnerable populations.',\n",
       "  \"Efforts to increase transparency regarding health care quality and safety are partially guided by the belief that making performance information publicly available will enable patients to make more informed choices. Although the amount of information reported on websites and through other channels has increased dramatically, use by consumers remains limited and largely restricted to white, college educated and middle aged consumers. There are many barriers that prevent patients from making effective use of current public reporting websites, including failure to recognize that quality may vary between providers, lack of awareness of publicly reported data, limited internet access, and low health literacy and numeracy. Innovative approaches are therefore needed to overcome barriers to using these data, particularly in vulnerable populations, to ensure a health care system in which every consumer can benefit from public reporting. Patient navigators have helped patients take greater advantage of the complex health care delivery environment, and use of patient navigators may be an effective approach to engage consumers and to help them to interpret the information presented in public reports. The scientific aims of the study are: 1) to test the efficacy of an office-based patient navigator to assist low income pregnant women in using publicly reported data to select a pediatric care provider; 2) to assess the efficacy of the intervention in subgroups defined by parity, race/ethnicity, and health literacy; 3) to evaluate the importance of publicly reported information about quality compared to other factors when selecting a pediatric provider; and 4) to assess the intervention's impact on self-management of health care. English speaking women ages 16-45 attending the prenatal clinic at a large urban medical center will be recruited, enrolled, consented and randomized to the navigator intervention or an informational pamphlet control between 24-34 weeks of gestation. Women randomized to the intervention arm will receive two 20 minute sessions with a trained patient navigator who will guide women in navigating and interpreting information about the quality of care provided at local pediatric practices on the Massachusetts Health Quality Partners web site. A survey designed for the purpose of this study will be administered at baseline and post-intervention. Health literacy, numeracy and level of activation for self-management of health care will also be assessed as potential mediators of intervention effectiveness. The primary study outcome will be the average performance on quality measures for the practices selected in the intervention and control groups. Secondary outcomes will include analyses of efficacy among groups of women defined by parity and an assessment of the relative importance of factors considered when choosing a pediatric care provider. Successful completion of the study aims will yield important new knowledge about the value of guided web-site navigation as a strategy to reduce disparities in the use of publicly reported information.\",\n",

Little has been done to explore the potential direct effect an increased body temperature may have on autism symptomology.

       "  'The goal of this study is to evaluate the hypothesis that the addition of liraglutide, a long-acting glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) analogue, to a calorie-restricted diet will lead to greater weight loss than will a calorie-restricted diet alone in subjects who are older (50 to 60 years of age), overweight/obese, and prediabetic. These individuals have been selected for study because they are at greatly increased risk to develop type 2 diabetes (2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD), and it is hypothesized that the addition of liraglutide to a calorie-restricted diet will significantly decrease risk of these adverse outcomes. There is considerable evidence that GLP-I compounds, including liraglutide, improve glycemic control in patients with manifest 2DM. However, there is relatively little information as to the potential utility of these compounds in nondiabetic individual at greatly increased risk of 2DM and CVD. This research proposal is aimed at providing some of this information by quantifying the effects of liraglutide, a long-acting GLP-1 analogue, on weight loss, insulin secretion, insulin action, and multiple CVD risk factors in a very high risk group—older, overweight/obese, prediabetic individuals. Furthermore, by using specific methods, not surrogate estimates, and avoiding the confounding effects of glucotoxicity, it will be possible to gain new insights into the effects of GLP-1 on insulin secretion and insulin action.',\n",

The individual CBT program has been tailored over the last five years to the clinical needs of high-functioning youth with ASD.',\n",
       "  'Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is among the most common childhood developmental disorders. A key goal in the field is the discovery of methods that reduce core autism symptoms. Core autism symptoms include social-cognitive impairments, pragmatic language deficits, and repetitive and rigid behaviors. The core symptoms tend to be stable and resistant to intervention. Most treatments involve group-based social skills training (SST), with limited effects. No treatment for core autism symptoms in school-aged children with ASD meets American Psychological Association guidelines for possible efficacy. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) offers a novel approach for addressing core autism symptoms in higher functioning school-age youngsters. Initial results suggest that individual CBT may also be promising for reducing core autism symptoms (Wood et al., 2009b; Drahota, Wood et al., 2011). The treatment is based on a contemporary model of memory retrieval competition, employing strategies for enhancing the retention of adaptive conceptual and behavioral responses and the suppression of idiosyncratic beliefs and behaviors in daily social contexts, emphasizing the use of deep semantic processing to enhance memory retrieval. We are proposing a randomized controlled trial to examine the efficacy of individual CBT relative to a standard community treatment in youngsters with ASD.',\n",

Additionally, the purpose of this study is to investigate the effects (if any) associated with the Blom low profile voice inner cannula and the Passy-Muir one-way tracheotomy tube speaking valves on swallowing behavior and biomechanical movement of the hyolaryngeal complex during routine diagnostic modified barium swallowing evaluations.',\n",
       "  'The goal of a one-way tracheotomy tube speaking valve is to allow cognitively intact individuals who require a tracheotomy tube communicate with their own voice. All non-verbal communication strategies have shortcomings. Lip reading is unreliable, communication boards are simplistic, writing very laborious, and computerized augmentative communication systems too costly. This inability to communicate effectively prevents optimal patient participation in their plan-of-care. Verbal communication, therefore, plays an integral role in psychological functioning, social interactions, and overall medical care. The primary criteria for determining success or failure of any one-way tracheotomy tube speaking valve is how well it allows for adequate voice intensity greater than ambient room noise to achieve both audible voice production and intelligible speech. The first purpose of this study is to investigate voice production and speech intelligibility abilities associated with the Blom low profile voice inner cannula and the Passy-Muir one-way tracheotomy tube speaking valves. It is hypothesized that there will be no significant differences between the two speaking valves regarding physiologic parameters, voice production, or speech intelligibility capabilities. There are conflicting reports in the literature regarding the relationship between a tracheotomy tube and swallowing success. Some authors report an improvement in swallowing success when the tracheotomy tube is occluded while others report no change in aspiration status based on occlusion status of the tracheotomy tube. Recently, it has been reported that there was no causal relationship between the tracheotomy tube and aspiration status. There is a paucity of research, to date, reporting on movement of the hyolaryngeal complex based upon occlusion status of a tracheotomy tube or presence of a tracheotomy tube. The second purpose of this study is to investigate how the Blom low profile voice inner cannula and the Passy-Muir one-way tracheotomy tube speaking valves impact on swallowing behavior and movement of the hyolaryngeal complex during routine diagnostic modified barium swallow evaluations.',\n",

       "  'Obesity over the pre- and postmenopausal years is linked to the risk of postmenopausal breast cancer. Multiple mechanisms are likely to contribute to obesity associated breast cancer risk. They include increased insulin like growth factor (IGF)-I bioavailability, oxidative stress, raised leptin to adiponectin ratio, and increased inflammatory cytokines which are responsible for the creation of a systemic and local hyperestrogenic milieu by induction of aromatase and may also be responsible for the reduction in antitumor immunity by stimulation of immunosuppressive cells. While derivative chromosome disulfiram (DER) has been shown to reverse some of these obesity related phenotypic features, it is not yet established whether DER reduces breast cancer risk using validated tissue biomarkers predictive of breast cancer development. N:3FA (3-fatty acids) have been shown to ameliorate obesity-induced effects on circulating leptin and adiponectin, insulin resistance, endogenous estrogen production and inflammation. Although preclinical studies have indicated a protective effect of n:3FA on mammary carcinogenesis, the data in humans are inconclusive, likely as a result of the lack of controlled clinical trials. Investigators hypothesize that the combination of DER and n:3FA will reduce breast cancer risk in an additive/synergistic fashion through their complementary effects on the multiple inter-related pathways accounting for the obesity associated breast cancer risk. Investigators propose to conduct a clinical trial study involving overweight and obese women between the ages of 30 and 55 who are at high risk of breast cancer and are found on random periareolar fine needle aspiration to have hyperplasia with or without atypia with Ki67 ≥2 if premenopausal and ≥1.5 if postmenopausal.

For this study, PQ will be withheld for 28 days so as to study the efficacy of CQ alone since masking effect over one another was found when CQ is given with PQ. So the investigators are not sure whether the recurrence is due to resistance to CQ or CQ concentration in blood is below therapeutic level or it is due to PQ is in inadequate dose. From this study the investigators will get findings like may be CQ is still working for P.vivax or no longer working for P.vivax due to resistance developed by P.vivax parasites. So for P.vivax which is not responding to CQ therapy, the investigators will go for second line treatment with ACT in a similar fashion as it is given for P. falciparum infection in Bhutan. And if the investigators find CQ is still working for P.vivax infection, the next level of study will be to compare higher dose of PQ with standard dose of PQ ( as practiced now) in lieu of bringing down the relapse rates in P. vivax infection.',\n",

May be this is mainly due to intensive measures taken place in controlling the diseases especially vector control measures. So that way P.falciparum has gone now. But on other hand P.vivax has peaked the infection. The main reason could be due to resistant to Chloroquine or may be Chloroquine dose is inadequate, and it could also mean it could be due to relapses from the hypnozoites stage where Primaquine dose could be inadequate. Therefore this study is developed to study the efficacy of Chloroquine alone withholding Primaquine for day 28 slightly deviating from the current treatment protocol of Bhutan. That parasitic clearance and recurrence rates will be recorded while on Chloroquine and Primaquine separately. For those patients whose blood stage of parasites doesnt get cleared with standard dose of Chloroquine or for any recurrences occurring before day 28, will be treated with second line treatment with ACT, and the blood level of Chloroquine(drug concentration) will be determined to say whether that could be due to resistance or due to low level of Chloroquine in the blood. And for any recurrences occurring after day 28 while of Primaquine or after completion of Primaquine dosage for a total of 14 days (from day 29 to day 42) those patients will be treated in a similar fashion as initial treatment with Chloroquine and Primaquine and the recurrence rates will be recorded so as to develop next level of study where two different doses of Primaquine (high dose vs low dose) will be compared to study the efficacy of Primaquine.',\n",

       "  'Comparison Between an Anterior Rhinoscopic Scoring Scale With the Sniff Test to Predict Nasal Insertability Before Transnasal Endoscopy: A Prospective, Randomized, Controlled Study',\n",
       "  'A sniff test for nasal patency is a common method before ultrathin transnasal esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (UT-EGD) to select the right or left nostril for insertion, yet there is no objective method to select an appropriate meatus insertion site (MIS) where tolerance and epistaxis rate can be improved. The investigators hypothesize that that an objective anterior rhinoscopy (to be more specific, the investigators term it \"anterior meatoscopy\") method might be more effective than the subjective breathing-in method (sniff test) to select the appropriate meatus insertion site, thus reducing nasal bleeding and nasal discomfort. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of an endoscopic meatus scoring scale (EMSS) by anterior meatoscopy (AM) to select a MIS on patient tolerance and adverse events during nasal anesthesia and UT-EGD. The investigators will perform a prospective randomized-controlled trial to compare patient tolerability and adverse events during nasal anesthesia and endoscopy between the AM-selected and self-selected MIS. A total of 233 consecutive patients with epigastric discomfort (symptoms of non-ulcer dyspepsia) will be included in the study in a large tertiary referral hospital in Taiwan.',\n",
       "  'Transnasal esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (UT-EGD) offers physicians and patients a number of advantages compared with conventional peroral EGD (P-EGD) and has become increasingly popular in clinical practice over the past several years. However, insertion failure varying from 2.3% to 62.7% due to tight nasal vault have been reported. Dumortire reported 17.9 % of patient refused UT-EGD due to nasal pain and epistaxis remains to be a common side effect. Therefore a well performed nasal anesthesia has been regarded as the most important step for UT-EGD. The concept of endoscopic guidance is actually an application of anterior rhinoscopy to select the most patent meatus for nasal anesthesia and endoscopic insertion. The scope should be placed in the side of the nasal cavity that is most patent. Therefore, it is reasonable that a nasal examination is performed prior to UT-EGD to determine the less obstructed side. In fact, anterior rhinoscopy is a common outpatient procedure by otolaryngologists and is performed with an otoscope. Instead, we use a transnasal endoscope to select the most patent meatus and thus we first introduce the concept of anterior \"meatus-copy\", which is different from \"meatoscopy\" for the urinary meatus. The conventional sniff nasal patency test is an inspection of nasal passability by asking a patient to compare the breathing-in air flow in either side of the nose. This is a self-selected and subjective method of choosing just the right or left nostril for transnasal endoscopy. Nasal septum and nasal turbinates, especially the inferior turbinates, are erectile tissues in the nose, fluctuate greatly in size depending on physiological changes (e.g. body temperature and exercise) and response to inflammation. Often, the sensation of a blocked nose is subjective. The otolaryngologist may find a perfectly patent airway and yet the patient will insist that his nose is clogged up. Therefore, an objective method to evaluate nasal patency would help to avoid a narrowed meatus, thereby reducing nasal pain and epistaxis during nasal anesthesia and transnasal endoscopy. Methods used to objectively measure nasal patency and resistance include rhinomanometry and acoustic rhinometry. However, these two methods are sophisticated and not straightforward. There is no literature describing the optimal selection method for transnasal endoscopic insertion. Assessments of nasal patency by dynamic methods include nasal peak flow, rhinomanometry, and acoustic rhinometry. However, a convenient endoscopic method of evaluating nasal meatus patency has not been proposed. Locating on the anterior portion of a meatus, the transnasal endoscope itself can act as a nasoscope to look for the most patent meatus. We found anterior meatuscopy allows the direct visualisation of the turbinates and meatus without causing discomfort. Thus it may be a useful ancillary technique to select the most patent meatus for scope insertion. Hence, the primary objective of this study is to evaluate whether a anterior meatuscopy scoring system could reduce nasal bleeding and improve tolerance associated with UT-EGD.',\n",

The proposed study will test a person-centred intervention tailored the women's needs in a randomised controlled trial.

GSD involves systematic use of condition-adjusted worksheets ('reflection sheets'), and advanced professional communication. Using reflection sheets filled out by each woman as the starting point for communication, problem solving will be tailored her personal needs. We expect that the intervention has the potential to support the women in better managing specific complications and difficulties related to concerns about recovery, body perception, fertility and establishment of intimate relations with their partner, all aspects important for the women's quality of life in the follow-up period after cancer diagnosis and treatment.

       "  'Evidence demonstrates that chronic stress doubles the risk of myocardial infarction and contributes to proinflammatory processes implicated in coronary artery disease and stroke. Veterans who have experienced combat are at greater risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared to noncombat Veterans and non-Veterans. However, previous research has focused primarily on male Veterans. Yet statistics reveal a startling number (81-92%) of women Veterans report at least one traumatic event sometime in their lives and women Veterans experience significant rates of prior life adversity such as sexual assault, physical violence, and combat exposure. Compelling evidence demonstrates a strong relationship between the breadth of prior life adversity, proinflammatory cytokines and stress-related inflammatory disease, such as CVD. Assisting women Veterans to reduce stress and develop coping strategies may improve psychological well-being and reduce CVD risk. Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) involves intensive training in mindfulness, which promotes positive adaptation to life stress. MBSR has been found to reduce symptoms of depression and improve quality of life in Veterans experiencing Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Practitioners of MBSR gain increased awareness and insight into the relationship among their thoughts, emotions, and somatic reactivity which can facilitate change in conditioned patterns of emotional reaction. However, only minimal research and no randomized control trials (RCTs) have examined MBSR as an intervention for reducing CVD risk in women Veterans. Furthermore, previous studies have neither examined CVD risk objectively using a well-established CVD risk score nor measured endothelial dysfunction. Endothelial dysfunction is acknowledged to precede atherosclerosis and is a strong predictor of CVD. Furthermore, studies demonstrate that lifestyle changes, such exercise and yoga, can reverse endothelial dysfunction. However, no studies were found that considered endothelial function in relation to MBSR. Moreover, potential protective and risk factors, such as prior life adversity, social support, health behaviors, acculturation, and diurnal cortisol, posited to moderate the effect of psychological well-being and inflammation on MBSR have not been examined. Women Veterans between the ages of 18 and 70 years who have at least one CVD risk factors (as defined by Framingham CVD Risk Scale) will be randomized into either an 8-week MBSR program or health education control program. The following specific aims will be addressed: (1) Determine the extent to which training in MBSR (1) improves psychological well-being, (2) decreases inflammatory burden, and (3) reduces cardiovascular risk in women Veterans; and (2) Evaluate protective and risk factors posited to moderate the effect of MBSR on psychological well being, inflammatory burden and cardiovascular risk in women Veterans. Age, body mass index (BMI), menstrual status, medications, and socioeconomic status (SES) will be evaluated as covariates. The proposed research is innovative in that MBSR has not been evaluated in women Veterans at risk for CVD. The investigators expect that MBSR will improve psychological well-being and reduce CVD risk with improvements sustained for at least 6 months. Given that CVD is a major cause of mortality, this research may have broader implications for reducing CVD in the general population.',\n",

       "  'BACKGROUND Much of the clinical practice of oncology involves palliative care. In this setting ,the emphasis is on alleviation of symptoms and preservation or improvement of quality of life. A large body of clinical evidence documents the effectiveness of local-field external beam radiotherapy in palliation of pain from osseous metastases (1). Despite this general agreement, controversy remains regarding the optimal dose and fractionation schedule. Prospective phase III clinical trials (2-6), today, have failed to demonstrate superiority of one schedule over another ,and as a result, the patterns of practice of remain diverse in duration and intensity. Between 1974 and 1980 the RTOG conducted a large national study to determine the effectiveness of five different dose fractionation schedules(2). A total of 1016 patients were entered ,266 into a \"solitary metastasis\" stratum, and 750 into a \"multiple metastasis \" stratum. The former were randomly assigned to treatment with 40,5Gy in 15 fractions or 20Gy in 5 fractions. The latter were assigned to 30Gy in 10 fractions, 15 Gy in5 fractions ,20 Gy in 5 fractions, or 25 Gy in 5 fractions. A quantitative measure of pain ,based on severity and frequency of pain, and the type and frequency of pain medications used, was devised to evaluate response. Overall, 89% of patients experienced minimal relief. There were no significant difference between the treatment arms in both strata. The initial pain score was found to be a useful predictor ; patients with high score were less likely to respond and were less likely to experience a complete response. Patients with breast and prostate cancer were significantly more likely to respond than patients with lung or other primary lesions. Patients completing their treatment as planned had significantly higher rates of complete response than those who did not .While some relief was experienced almost invariably within the first four weeks, complete relief was first reported later than four weeks after start of treatment in about 50 % of patients .The median duration of minimal and complete pain relief was 20 and 12 weeks ,respectively. There were no significant differences in duration of pain relief between the different arms It was concluded that all treatment dose schedules were equally effective. A reanalysis of the RTOG study was reported by Blitzer (7).Using a stepwise logistic regression, he examined the effect of the number of fractions, the dose per fraction, and solitary versus multiple metastases, on the probability of attaining complete pain relief and the need for retreatment. This multivariate technique allowed patients with solitary and multiple metastases to be analyzed together. By increasing the number of subjects and events the statistical power of the analysis was outcome. There was no correlation of the time dose factor with outcome (8). It was concluded that the more protracted schedules resulted in improved pain relief. Price et al. randomized 288 patients to receive either 8 Gy in one fraction or 30 Gy in 10 daily fractions. Pain was assessed using a questionnaire completed by the patients at the home on a daily basis. No differences were found in the probability of attaining pain relief, the speed of onset or the duration of relief between the two arms(4). Hoskin et al. randomized 270 patients to receive either 4 Gy or 8 Gy in one fraction (3) Pain assessed by the patient) and analgesic usage were recorded before treatment and at 2,4,8 and 12 weeks. At 4 weeks the response rates were 69% for 8 Gy and 44% for 4 Gy (p<0.001). The duration of the effect was independent of dose. Two other randomized trials have been reported (5,6). Given the small difference in the Biological Effective Dose ( BED) between the arms (6) and the small number of patients accrued (5,6), it is not surprising that no differences between the treatment arms were detected. RTOG have reported the results of a pooled data dose response analysis (11). A computerized literature search was conducted to identify prospectively randomized clinical studies which addressed this issue and the results of these studies (2 6) were pooled together to form a database for analysis. The endpoint selected for analysis was complete response (CR). It was felt that this endpoint was most likely to be evaluated in a consistent fashion by different investigators. One study (6) was excluded from the analysis because outcome was not reported using conventional definitions of complete and partial response. To allow comparison of the different study arms, the BED was calculated for each schedule. Odds ratios calculated for various dose levels showed a statistically significant increase from 1.00 to 3.32 as the BED increased from 14.4 Gy to 5 1.4 Gy. For the first time, RTOG analysis demonstrated a highly significant dose response relationship for palliation of pain from bone metastases with radiotherapy. Furthermore, there was no evidence of flattening of the dose¬-response curve within the dose range tested, suggesting that further gains can be realized at doses outside of the range tested. We propose a phase II clinical trial in which the biological effective dose will be increased by the concurrent use of a radiosensitizer. The main advantage of this approach over escalation of the physical dose is the avoidance of increase in the overall treatment time. Capecitabine is a fluoropyrimidine carbamate with antineoplastic activity. It is an orally administered systemic prodrug of 5\\' deoxy 5 fluorouridine (5\\' DFUR) which is converted to 5 Capecitabine is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. In the liver, a 60 kDa carboxyesterase hydrolyzes much of the compound to 5\\' deoxy 5 fluorocytidine (5\\' DFCR). Cytidine deaminase, an enzyme found in most tissues, including tumors, subsequently converts 5\\' DFCR to 5\\' deoxy 5 fluorouridine (5\\' DFUR).. The enzyme, thymidine phosphorylase (dThdPase), then hydrolyzes 5\\' DFUR to the active drug 5 FU. Many tissues throughout the body express thymidine phosphorylase. Some human carcinomas express this enzyme in higher concentrations than surrounding normal tissues. Both normal and tumor cells metabolize 5 FU to 5¬fluoro 2 deoxyuridine monophosphate (FdUMP) and 5 fluorouridine triphosphate (FUTP). These metabolites cause cell injury by two different mechanisms. First, HUMP and the folate cofactor, N5 10¬methylenetetrahydrofolate, bind to thymidylate synthase (TS) to form a covalently bound ternary complex. This binding inhibits the formation of thymidylate from uracil. Thymidylate is the necessary precursor of thymidine triphosphate, which is essential for the synthesis of DNA, so that a deficiency of this compound can inhibit cell division. Second, nuclear transcriptional enzymes can mistakenly incorporate FUTP in place of uridine triphosphate (UTP) during the synthesis of RNA. This metabolic error can interfere with RNA processing and protein synthesis. Capecitabine is already approved for use in patients with metastatic breast cancer resistant to both paclitaxel and an anthracycline containing chemotherapy regimen. Although 5FU is an established radiosensitizer, the exact mechanism by which it enhances cell kill is not well understood. Sensitization is schedule dependent and is maximal when a cytocidal concentration of 5FU is given after the radiation exposure (12). The effect does not result from increased sublethal damage or inhibition of sublethal damage repair (12,13). Current evidence suggests that radiosensitization by 5FU is mediated through its effects on DNA rather then RNA (14). In vivo (15) as well as clinical studies (16) have demonstrated the superiority of continuous over bolus infusion of 5FU. Over the last several decades, concurrent 5FU and radiation have been used successfully in a variety of malignancies. Several important lessons have been learned from clinical trials (16). Simultaneous delivery of large (IV bolus) doses of 5 fluorouracil with irradiation is associated with improved survival compared to treatment with radiation alone, but at a price of increased normal tissue toxicity. These side effects can be ameliorated by using protracted venous infusion. This is an efficacious approach, with a wide therapeutic index, which permits concurrent treatment of micrometastatic disease and radiation sensitization. Combined modality therapy, including irradiation and concurrently administered 5FU based chemotherapy, has become the mainstay of therapy for anal and rectal cancers. Protracted venous infusion chemoradiation is also used in the preoperative management of rectal cancer and in the nonoperative management of anal cancers. The Gastrointestinal Tumor Study Group (GITSG) has demonstrated a significant survival advantage for patients who receive adjuvant combined radiation and bolus 5FU following curative resection of pancreatic cancer (17,18). Similar advantages have been demonstrated in unresectable pancreatic cancers. Significant advantages have also been shown for concurrent chemotherapy regiments containing 5FU in esophageal cancer (19), squamous cell carcinoma of the Head and Neck (20,21), and carcinoma of the cervix (22). There is very limited experience with the use of capecitabine and radiation. Based on its relative selectivity and the increase in tumor cell 5FU levels, it should be expected that capecitabine will provide superior radiosensitization at equivalent or reduced systemic toxicity levels. Interestingly, it has been recently reported that radiation induces thymidine phosphorylase and enhances the efficacy of capecitabine in human cancer xenografts (23). This may further enhance the synergistic effects, and consequently the therapeutic ratio. In RTOG study a substantial number of patients with gastrointestinal malignancies treated with concurrent radiotherapy and capecitabine at a dose of 1600 mg/m2/day (5 days a week) with very little toxicity(24 ).In phase II study of chemoradiation for rectal cancer 1650mg/m2/d of capecitabine for 14 days was safe and well-tolerated treatment(25). In this study we will investigate the feasibility of concurrent Capecitabine and external beam radiotherapy, as well as collect preliminary data regarding the efficacy of this regimen. OBJECTIVES Hypothesis: Given the hypothesis that regimens employing greater intensity radiation yield higher rates of pain relief, radiosensitization using a tumor targeted drug like Xeloda should improve the rate of complete pain relief as compared to radiosensitization with 5FU alone. Primary Objective: To determine the frequency and duration of pain relief and narcotic relief for the proposed regimen. Secondary Objective: To determine the toxicity of concurrent Capecitabine and radiotherapy in breast cancer patients with bone metastases. Eligibility Criteria Patients with metastatic breast will be allowed on the study regardless of their prior exposure to chemotherapy. Today, there is no evidence to suggest crossresistance between radiotherapy and prior chemotherapy, or that response to radiotherapy is related in any way to the number of lines of chemotherapy used in a particular patient. Good palliative responses can often be achieved in heavily pretreated patients. 1. The patient must be 18 years of age or older. 2. The patient must have histologically proven breast adenocarcinoma. 3. Radiographic evidence of bone metastasis is required .Acceptable studies include plain radiographs, radionuclide bone scans, computed tomography scans and magnetic resonance imaging. 4 .The patient must have pain that appears to be related to the radiographically documented metastasis. 5. Patients receiving systemic therapy with Capecitabine to metastatic disease (according to health basket ). 6. Patients must have an estimated life expectancy of 3 months or greater. 7. Patients will be eligible for treatment of multiple metastases only if these can be included in no more than two treatment sites. 8. Signed study specific informed consent. 9 Karnofsky Performance Status > 40. 10. Calculated Creatinine Clearance > 50 ml/min 11.ALT and AST no greater than 3 5 times the institutional normal; bilirubin and serum creatinine no greater than 1.5 times normal; ANC greater than 1500, and platelets at least 100,00. Exclusion Criteria 1. Prior radiation therapy or prior palliative surgery to the painful site. 2. Impending fracture of the treatment site or planned surgical fixation of the bone. 3. Patients with clinical or radiographic evidence of spinal cord or cauda equina compression. 4. Patients receiving systemic radionuclides (strontium, samarium, etc.) within 60 days prior to registration. PRETREATMENT EVALUATION 1. Histologic diagnosis of the primary site. 2. Radiographic assessment, with must include plain x-ray of the index lesion (s) and a bone scane. 3. Pain assessment score (BPI ). 4. Laboratory studis within 2 weeks of registration (CBC, serum ALT, AST ,total bilirubin and creatinine). RADIATION THERAPY 1. Treatment must be given using 6-15MV photons or 6-18 MeV electrons . 2. All fields must be treated each day. Treatment volume will include the radiographic abnormality with at least a 2 cm margin. Treatment of the entire bone is not required. 3. Anterior and posterior parallel opposed fields will be used for lumbar spine, sacrum, and extremity sites. Equal weighting is recommended, although unequal weighting may be used for the lumbar or sacral spine with a ratio of doses of 1:2 AP:PA. Dose will be prescribed at mid depth at the central axis, or at the center of target volume if unequal weighting is used. Alternatively, the lumbar spine may be treated with a single PA field, with the dose prescribed to the mid vertebral body as defined by a lateral simulator film. 4. Single posterior fields will be used for the thoracic spine and scapula .The treatment depth is set at the middle of the vertebral body, as determined by a lateral simulation film. 5. The cervical spine may be treated with either parallel opposed lateral fields or with a single posterior field. When lateral fields are used, the isocenter should be at mid thickness, with the dose prescribed to the mid vertebral body. 6. Pubic. bone lesions will be treated with a single anterior field at a depth determined by lateral radiograph or CT scan. 7. Clavicular lesions will be treated with a single anterior field at a depth of 3 cm. The dose will be prescribed to the 3 cm depth. An alternative depth may be used as determined by CT scan or other radiographs. 8. Rib metastases may be treated with electrons or with photons. When electrons are used, the appropriate energy should be chosen such that the entire lesion is covered by the 90% (or higher) isodose curve. The dose will be prescribed to the 100% isodose line. When photons are used, parallel opposed fields may be used, with the depth prescribed to the mid thickness. Tangential fields are strongly encouraged to avoid treatment of underlying structures. A single field may be used to cover the lesion, with the depth set at the estimated depth of the rib lesion, and the dose prescribed to that level. 9. When more than one osseous site is to be included into a treatment field, the treating radiation oncologist may use different field arrangements at herlhis discretion, with the goal of providing relatively uniform coverage of the target sites and minimum inclusion of uninvolved tissues. Radiation Dose All patients will receive radiotherapy to a dose 30 Gy in 10fractions (3 Gy per fraction) over two weeks. CHEMOTHERAPY Chemotherapy with capecitabine tablets will be given concurrently with radiotherapy in the dose 1400 mg/m2 orally, in two daily divided doses. Total daily dose rounded to the nearest 500 mg and divided into morning and evening Doses, as per the following table: Number of 500 mg tablets to be taken Surface Area Total Daily Dose morning evening (m2) (mg)* <= 1.08 1000 1 1 1.09 1.4 1500 2 1 1.41 1.71 2000 2 2 1.72 2.02 2500 3 2 *Total Daily Dose rounded to the nearest 500 mg and divided into morning and evening doses. Dose Limiting Toxicity i) >grade 3 non hematologic toxicity, except for diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, anorexia, alopecia, fever and/or local reactions. ii) grade 4 diarrhea lasting >3 days which is not controllable with loperamide or other such medications. Or grade 4 diarrhea that requires IV hydration. iii) grade 4 neutropenia lasting >3 days iv) grade 4 thrombocytopenia v) grade 2 hand foot syndrome. Dose adjustments will be as per the following table: Toxicity NCI Grades During a Course of Therapy Grade 1 Maintain dose Grade 2 1st appearance (non HFS) Interrupt until resolved to grade 0 1 1st appearance of HFS Interrupt until resolved to grade 0 1, then continue at 75 % of original dose. 2nd appearance Interrupt until resolved to grade 0 1, then continue at 75 % of original dose. 3rd appearance Interrupt until resolved to grade 0 1, then continue at 50 % of original dose. 4th appearance Discontinue treatment permanently Grade 3 1. st appearance Interrupt until resolved to grade 0 1, then continue at 75 % of original dose with prophylaxis where possible. 2. nd appearance Interrupt until resolved to grade 0 1, then continue at 50 % of original dose. 3. rd appearance Discontinue treatment permanently Grade 4 1st appearance Discontinue permanently or If physician deems it to be in the patient\\'s best interest to continue, interrupt until resolved to grade 0 1, then continue at 50 % of original dose . Dosage modifications are not recommended for grade 1 events. Therapy with capecitabine should be interrupted upon the occurrence of a grade 2 or 3 adverse experience. Once the adverse event has resolved or decreased in intensity to grade 1, then therapy may be restarted at full dose or as adjusted according to the above table. If a grade 4 experience occurs, therapy should be discontinued or interrupted until resolved or decreased to grade 1, and therapy should be restarted at 50% of the original dose. Doses of capecitabine omitted for toxicity are not replaced or restored; instead the patient should resume the planned treatment cycles. Once the dose has been reduced it should not be increased at a later time. Toxicity CAPECITABINE can induce diarrhea, sometimes severe. Patients with severe diarrhea should be carefully monitored and given fluid and electrolyte replacement if they become dehydrated. National Cancer Institute of Canada (NCIC grade 2 diarrhea is defined as an increase of 4 to 6 stools/day or nocturnal stools, grade 3 diarrhea as an increase of 7 to 9 stools/day or incontinence and malabsorption, and grade 4 diarrhea as an increase of >10 stools/day or grossly bloody diarrhea or the need for parenteral support. If grade 2, 3 or 4 diarrhea occurs, administration of capecitabine should be immediately interrupted until the diarrhea resolves or decreases in intensity to grade 1. Following grade 3 or 4 diarrhea, subsequent doses of capecitabine should be decreased. Standard antidiarrheal treatments (eg, loperamide) are recommended. Necrotizing enterocolitis (typhlitis) has also been reported. Hand and foot syndrome (palmar plantar erythrodysesthesia or chemotherapy induced acral erythema) is characterized by the following: numbness, dysesthesia/paresthesia, tingling, painless or painful swelling, erythema, desquamation, blistering and severe pain. Grade 2 hand and foot syndrome is defined as painful erythema and swelling of the hands and/or feet and/or discomfort affecting the patient\\'s activities of daily living. Grade 3 hand and¬foot syndrome is defined as moist desquamation, ulceration, blistering and severe pain of the hands and/or feet and/or severe discomfort that causes the patient to be unable to work or perform activities of daily living. If grade 2 or 3 hand and foot syndrome occurs, administration of capecitabine should be interrupted until the event resolves or decreases in intensity to grade 1. Following the occurrence of grade 2 handand foot syndrome, subsequent doses of capecitabine should be decreased. There has been cardiotoxicity associated with fluorinated pyrimidine therapy, including myocardial infarction, angina, dysrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, sudden death and electrocardiograph changes. These adverse events may be more common in patients with a prior history of coronary artery disease. Patients with mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction due to liver metastases should be carefully monitored when capecitabine is administered. The effect of severe hepatic dysfunction on the disposition of capecitabine is not known. If drug related grade 2 4 elevations in bilirubin occur, administration of capecitabine should be immediately interrupted until the hyperbilirubinernia resolves or decreases in intensity to grade 1. NCIC grade 2 hyperbilirubinernia is defined as 1.5 x normal, grade 3 hyperbilirubinemia as 1.5 3 x normal and grade 4 hyperbilirubinemia as >3 x normal. Increases in adverse events have been noted in patients with reduced renal function. Therefore, patients will be excluded for a calculated creatinine clearance of less than 50 ml/min. Myelosuppression was rare. Assessment of Response Pain scores and narcotic scores will be determined using the guidelines in following table: PAIN AND NARCOTIC CATEGORIES AND SCORES PAIN ANALGESIA Severity 0 No pain 0 None I Mild I Analgesics (ASA, Bufferin, Tylenol, Anacin, etc.) 2 Moderate 2 Mild Narcotic, (< 112 gr. codeine, Darvon, etc.) 3 Severe 3 Moderate Narcotic (> 112 < gr. codeine, Percoan, etc) 4 Strong 4 Narcotic, (> 1 gr. codeine, demerol, morphine, etc) Frequency 0 None 0 None I Occasional (< daily) I p.r.n. (< daily) 2 Intermittent (at least daily) 2 q.d. (I tab. or cap./day) 3 Frequent (>. I < 3 daily) 3 b.i.d. t.i.d. (> I < 4 tab. or cap./day) 4 Constant (most of the time) 4 > t.i.d. (> 4 tab. or cap./day) Pain Score = Pain Severity Grade x Pain Frequency Grade Narcotic Score = Analgesia Severity Grade x Analgesic Frequency Grade Response will be evaluated by questionnaires at follow up visit at 2, 4 and 8 weeks after completion of radiotherapy and by phone call interviews (when necessary for completeness) in poor compliance patients. The \"worst pain score\" will be used as response endpoint. The time to maximal pain relief is the time from the first day of irradiation to the time of the lowest pain score for average pain. Response Definitions Complete response is defined as an average pain score of 0 for two consecutive analysis periods. Narcotic consumption must not be increased. Partial response. A decrease of at least 2 points in the worst pain score for two consecutive analysis periods. Narcotic consumption must not be increased. No response (any of the following): A pain score that does not change within 8 weeks from the start of radiation therapy. A 2 point increase in worst pain score that is sustained at a higher level in the month following the first day of radiation therapy. A pain score that drops by at least 2 points and subsequent sustained rise (on 2 successive questionnaires) of pain score by at least 2 points. Any patient with progressive pain in the treated area should have plain radiographs of the area to assess for bone stability and pathologic fracture. References. 1. Hoskin PJ.

       "  'This is a study of the short-term effects of ivacaftor on sweat chloride concentration and lung function in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients who fall outside current FDA approval. This new, first of its kind drug is approved for use only in CF patients with the G551D mutation in whom it safely confers considerable benefits. However, it is highly likely that CF patients with many other mutations can benefit similarly from this drug, some of whom can be identified by phenotype or genotype. We will enroll up to 30 CF subjects with clinical presentations in which there is one or more signs of residual CF channel function. The signs of residual function include: normal digestion, concentration of chloride in sweat between 55 and 85, or milder than expected CF disease in a CF patient with severe gene mutations. The primary outcome measure will be the difference in sweat chloride concentration measured in subjects on placebo and on ivacaftor. Secondary outcome measured will be lung function.',\n",
       "  'Ivacaftor is a cystic fibrosis (CF)channel potentiator that is associated with decreased sweat chloride concentration, improved lung function, and improved weight gain. It is currently FDA approved for use only in CF patients with the G551D gating mutation. In vivo data suggest that ivacaftor may potentiate CF channels coded for by many other mutations associated with residual channel function, i.e., that some CF protein is present in the cell membrane of affected cells. This includes all of the 9 other known gating mutations, but ivacaftor also may be effective in CF patients with non-gating mutations, including some associated with severe phenotype. Based on results from previous studies, we hypothesize that non-G551D patients with signs of residual CF channel activity might respond favorably to treatment with ivacaftor. This includes patients with any of the non-G551D gating mutations, that are pancreatic sufficient, that have a sweat chloride concentration between 55 and 85 mmol, or that are much healthier than expected. Hence, select CF patients treated with ivacaftor as compared to placebo will have a decrease in sweat chloride concentration by greater than 20 mmol, improvement in FEV1, and weight gain. To test our hypothesis, we will conduct a prospective double-blinded placebo-controlled crossover clinical study comparing treatment with ivacaftor to placebo therapy (see details below). Our specific aims are: Specific Aim 1: To demonstrate a decrease in sweat chloride concentration by greater than 20 mmol from baseline after 14 days of ivacaftor as compared to placebo. Specific Aim 2: To demonstrate improvement in lung function measures from baseline after 14 days of Ivacaftor as compared to placebo. Specific Aim 3:To demonstrate weight gain from baseline after 14 days of Ivacaftor as compared to placebo. Study Design: This is a prospective randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled crossover study of the short-term effects of ivacaftor (aka VX-770 or Kalydeco) on sweat chloride concentration and lung function in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients who fall outside current FDA approval. We will enroll up to 30 CF subjects from the UCSF CF Center with a variety of genotypes and phenotypes in which there is one or more signs of residual CFTR function. The signs of residual CF channel function include: pancreatic sufficiency, sweat chloride concentration less than 85 mmol, or milder than expected CF disease in a CF patient with a severe genotype. We will exclude patients who are homozygous for the F508del mutation and have a sweat chloride concentration greater 85 mmol, which is true of the majority of F508del homozygotes. This population has been studied and found to be unresponsive to ivacaftor and includes nearly half of all CF patients. However, even among F508del homozygotes about 15 percent have residual chloride secretion manifest as a lower than expected sweat chloride concentration. The primary outcome measure will be the difference in sweat chloride concentration measured in subjects on placebo and on ivacaftor. Secondary outcome measures include variables obtained by spirometry and multi-breath washout testing. Research Plan: We will conduct a randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled crossover trial, in which all subjects will be treated with 2 weeks of ivacaftor and 2 weeks of placebo with a 2-week wash out period. Up to 30 subjects with one or more signs of residual CFTR function will be randomized into the study. This includes subjects who are pancreatic sufficient, who have a sweat chloride of 55 to 85 mmol, or who have mild CF disease in a setting of a severe CF genotype. Each subject will act as his/her own control in a prospective randomized double-blinded crossover trial consisting of 14 days of ivacaftor or placebo, followed by a 14 day washout period, followed by 14 days of placebo or ivacaftor. The primary outcome measure will be sweat chloride concentration at baseline, 14 days, 28 days and 42 days. Secondary outcomes include standard lung function measures: forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV1), FEV1/FVC and mid-expiratory flow (FEF25-75), and multibreath washout testing. Blood samples will be examined at baseline, 14 days, 28 days and 42 days for evidence of drug toxicity (CBC with differential, liver function tests (AST, ALT), non-fasting glucose, creatinine and BUN). For female subjects of child bearing age, a urine pregnancy test will be done to assure they are not pregnant. If a female becomes pregnant during the study, the trial will be stopped but we will continue to measure sweat chloride, lung function, and blood work at the specified times. The effects of ivacaftor on the fetus are not known at this time. Results of all laboratory tests will be forwarded to a nurse practitioner not directly involved with the study subjects, who will serve as the subject safety monitor. The nurse practitioner will notify study investigators of any laboratory values consistent with an adverse effect of study drug and will have the power to discontinue any subject in case of a serious adverse event. The most common serious adverse event in previous ivacaftor trials was mild elevation of liver tests. For this trial a serious adverse event sufficient to warrant discontinuing a subject will include a liver function test (ALT or AST) more than thrice the upper limit of normal, abnormal renal function or abnormal red or white cell counts.',\n",

       "  'The overall aim of this project is to compare sleep patterns and melatonin profiles in individuals with bipolar disorder during depression and after remission. The hypothesis is that sleep time, rest-activity cycles and melatonin onset will be delayed during depression and become less delayed after remission.',\n",
       "  'Bipolar disorder is a prevalent, disabling, and chronic mood disorder characterized by depressive symptoms that alternate with hypomanic, manic or mixed states. The depressive phase of this illness predominates and is associated with cognitive, occupational and social impairment, psychiatric comorbidity, and increased mortality from suicide and general medical problems. Clarification of the pathophysiology of this illness is important to improve treatment effectiveness. Various lines of evidence suggest that circadian factors play a role in the onset and maintenance of bipolar depression. Rhythmic clinical disturbances are found in the altered sleep-wake cycle, diurnal mood shifts, rest-activity changes, seasonal features, the cyclic pattern of relapse and remission and the polarity inversions that define this disorder. Chronotherapeutic treatments that act by modifying circadian phase have been shown to be effective in ameliorating the depressive symptoms of this illness. In addition to this circumstantial evidence, there is some more direct data implicating circadian dysfunction in bipolar depression. Genetic studies have documented associations between various circadian genes and bipolar illness. Actigraphic studies of activity levels have demonstrated illness-remission differences and phase advances in manic states. Though these latter studies employ more direct assessment methodologies, there are few articles that have attempted to investigate circadian processes in bipolar depression with the use of the core clock processes. These basic clock rhythms include core body temperature, cortisol levels and dim light melatonin onset. Because these physiological oscillations are less influenced by behavior and less prone to masking, they more accurately reflect the intrinsic timing of the central pacemaker. This study will use dim light melatonin onset and actigraphy to assess the status and changes in circadian phase between states of bipolar depression and their remission. Using a case control methodology, adult subjects will be evaluated during, and after remission from the depressive phase of bipolar disorder. General Aim The overall aim of this project is to compare the timing of dim-light melatonin onset and actigraphy-based activity patterns in adult patients with bipolar disorder in depressed vs remitted states. These markers will enable characterization of changes in circadian phase between illness and recovery. A case control design will enable the use of small sample sizes capable of identifying statistically significant changes in the timing of circadian rhythms in the two states of interest. Hypotheses It is predicted that the dim light melatonin onset and activity profile will be delayed in the depressed vs. the euthymic state of bipolar disorder. It is further anticipated that this phase delay will lessen when bipolar subjects achieve remission from their depression. Last, it is predicted that the circadian phase of the dim light melatonin onset and the activity profile will correlate, both being delayed in the depressive phase, and less delayed in euthymia.',\n",

Patients will be prospectively enrolled in this study if diagnosis of adenocarcinoma only has been histologically confirmed and they are eligible for (or have already started up to 6 months prior to inclusion) standard GnRH-agonist first line androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) combined with anti-androgen to achieve complete androgen blockade (CAB). UV1 vaccinations will be applied simultaneously with CAB. When indicated, patients may receive concomitant radiotherapy. The following 2-step design will be used: 1. Conventional dose escalation with at least 3 patients per dose level (3 selected dose levels). 2. Expansion of each dose level to a total of 7 patients for assessment of immune response levels 13 UV1 vaccinations will be given during the first 6 months (week 26) of treatment, unless clinical deterioration or unacceptable toxicity is encountered. GM-CSF (Leukine ®) will be administered locally 10-15 minutes before each UV1 vaccination. Hormone naïve patients will receive standard complete androgen blockade by GnRH-agonist (3 months depot formulation sc.) and bicalutamide 50 mg orally per day (CAB).
