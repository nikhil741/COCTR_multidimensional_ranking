Reproductive Risks        Contraception: The effects of VRC01 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this        reason, men and women of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate pregnancy        prevention per the investigator. This includes highly reliable established lifestyle of        complete abstinence of potentially reproductive sexual activity, or use of BOTH a long term        hormonal or barrier (e.g. implant, depot injection, IUD in female participant or female        partner of participant) method of contraception that is fully effective prior to dosing,        COMBINED WITH a barrier method (male or female condom) for all potentially reproductive        sexual activity. Pregnancy prevention must be maintained as effective and practiced        continuously for the duration of study participation. Females of childbearing-age must have        a negative pregnancy test result prior to receiving VRC01. During the course of the study,        if a female participant, or the partner of a male participant suspects or in fact becomes        pregnant, the effected participant should inform the study staff immediately, as well as        the woman's primary care physician. Subjects must use safe sex practices during the trial,        and particularly during the ATI phase, when risk of transmission of HIV may be increased.          -  EXCLUSION CRITERIA               1. Chronic hepatitis B, as evidenced by a positive test for hepatitis B surface                  antigen (HBsAg), or chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, as evidenced by a                  positive test for HCV RNA. Subjects with a positive test for HCV antibody and a                  negative test for HCV RNA are eligible.               2. Documented virologic failure to >1 cART regimen.               3. HIV immunotherapy or vaccine(s) received within 1 year prior to screening.               4. Any licensed or experimental non-HIV vaccination (e.g., hepatitis B, influenza,                  pneumococcal polysaccharide) received within 2 weeks prior to study enrollment.               5. Receipt of other investigational study agent within 28 days of enrollment.               6. Any active malignancy that may require systemic chemotherapy or radiation                  therapy.               7. Systemic immunosuppressive medications received within 3 months prior to                  enrollment (Not excluded: corticosteroid nasal spray or inhaler; topical                  corticosteroids for mild, uncomplicated dermatitis; or oral/parenteral                  corticosteroids administered for non-chronic conditions not expected to recur                  [length of therapy less than or equal to 10 days, with completion in greater than                  or equal to 30 days prior to enrollment]).               8.

Significant or unstable cardiac disease (e.g., angina, congestive heart                       failure, recent myocardial infarction).                    2. Severe illness, malignancy, immunodeficiency other than HIV, or any other                       condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would make the subject                       unsuitable for the study.               9. Active drug or alcohol use or any other pattern of behavior that, in the opinion                  of the investigator, would interfere with adherence to study requirements.              10. Breast-feeding.","Background:      - A combination of daily drugs (called cART) can keep human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) very      low for a long time. But cART can lose effectiveness and cause permanent side effects. If      treatment stops, HIV levels go up again. Researchers want to see if a new product can control      HIV levels when a person is off cART.      Objective:      - To see if the new product VRC01 is safe and can control the HIV level in the blood when a      person is not taking cART.      Eligibility:      - Adults ages 18-65 with HIV who are willing to interrupt their treatment for at least 24      weeks.      Design:        -  Participants will be screened with:        -  Physical exam        -  Medical history        -  Heart tests        -  Blood and urine tests.        -  Their HIV drugs may be switched. They will keep taking them until a few days after Visit           1.        -  Visit 1: Repeat screening procedures.        -  Participants will also have genetic testing and leukapheresis. For this, blood will be           removed through a needle in one arm and circulated through a machine that removes white           blood cells. The rest of the blood is returned through a needle in the other arm.        -  They will get the first study drug dose through a thin tube in an arm vein for about 1           hour.        -  For 24 weeks, participants will have 16 visits.

The current rule for starting treatment of HIV infection is to combine members from different      classes of anti-HIV drugs, such as 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and      either a PI or a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). However, these      combinations can be complicated and difficult to take, can cause a number of side effects,      and may become ineffective. Combinations that are simpler, better tolerated, and more      effective are needed. Because PIs can cause long-term side effects and because HIV can become      resistant to many of them at the same time, anti-HIV combination treatments that do not use      PIs are being tested.","HIV-1;Didanosine;Drug Therapy, Combination;Zidovudine;Nevirapine;Stavudine;Lamivudine;RNA, Viral;Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors;Anti-HIV Agents;Viral Load;Combivir;BMS 232632;Efavirenz;Treatment Naive;",Virus Diseases;Bacterial Infections and Mycoses;Immune System Diseases;,C0033607;C0019693;C0087111;C0882214,C0033607;C0019693;C0087111;C0456909;C0040808;C3897779;C0882214,C0282519;C0282519;C0033607;C4553491;C0019693;C3539181;C0877248;C0877248;C0087111;C3242385;C0087111;C3242385;C0087111;C0332218;C0456387;C0392366;C0947630;C0013227;C0870077;C3811910;C3539181;C3539181;C4684765;C1514892;C0034770,C0021051,C1535939;C0427780;C0013230;C3536994;C0813171;C0700589;C0064113;C0022625;C0033493;C0701159;C0013216;C0064113;C0013227;C0085173;C0039736;C0376705;C0002598;C0085170;C0032952;C3714514;C3714514;C0072916;C0026056;C0034414;C0040879;C0221423;C0087111;C0221423;C0087111;C0012634;C0140575;C1446409;C0723457;C0549206;C0005116;C0035608;C0042210;C0025663;C0204695;C0018270;C0001962;C1552867;C0006141;C0439662;C0027651;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0013227;C3641827;C0947630;C0947630;C0013227;C0947630;C0013227;C0013227;C0947630;C0304712;C0013227;C0947630;C0013227;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0013227;C0947630;C1299581;C3248622;C1550655;C1550655;C3245501;C3842337;C3842337;C1561542;C1706074;C4331837;C0944911;C4331837;C4331837;C4331837;C4331837;C4086490;C4283785;C3843408,C0087111;C0282519,20050601,,,Completed,24979445;24326304;20121419;20102271;16905783,206,41.2,0.08155986690213901,0.090257275831599,"Are HIV-positive.;;;;;;;;;;Have a viral load of at least 400 copies/ml within 90 days prior to study entry.;;;;;;;;;;Are at least 16 years old.;;;;;;;;;;Weigh at least 40 kg.;;;;;;;;;;Have a negative pregnancy test within 48 hours before starting study drugs, if female             and able to have children.;;;;;;;;;;Agree to use 2 effective methods of birth control while taking, and for 3 months after             stopping, the study medications.;;;;;;;;;;Provide written consent of a parent or guardian, if under 18 years of age.","Have taken anti-HIV drugs in the past.;;;;;;;;;;Are allergic to any of the study drugs or ingredients.;;;;;;;;;;Are pregnant or breast-feeding.;;;;;;;;;;Have taken any of the following drugs within 14 days prior to study entry: amiodarone,             astemizole, bepridil, cisapride, ergot or ergot derivatives, systemic itraconazole,             systemic ketoconazole, midazolam, propoxyphene, quinidine, rifampin, terfenadine,             thalidomide, triazolam, or St. John's wort.;;;;;;;;;;Have taken drugs that influence the immune system, HIV or other vaccines, or             investigational drugs within 30 days prior to study entry.
