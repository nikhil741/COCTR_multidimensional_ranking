Reproductive Risks        Contraception: The effects of VRC01 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this        reason, men and women of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate pregnancy        prevention per the investigator. This includes highly reliable established lifestyle of        complete abstinence of potentially reproductive sexual activity, or use of BOTH a long term        hormonal or barrier (e.g. implant, depot injection, IUD in female participant or female        partner of participant) method of contraception that is fully effective prior to dosing,        COMBINED WITH a barrier method (male or female condom) for all potentially reproductive        sexual activity. Pregnancy prevention must be maintained as effective and practiced        continuously for the duration of study participation. Females of childbearing-age must have        a negative pregnancy test result prior to receiving VRC01. During the course of the study,        if a female participant, or the partner of a male participant suspects or in fact becomes        pregnant, the effected participant should inform the study staff immediately, as well as        the woman's primary care physician. Subjects must use safe sex practices during the trial,        and particularly during the ATI phase, when risk of transmission of HIV may be increased.          -  EXCLUSION CRITERIA               1. Chronic hepatitis B, as evidenced by a positive test for hepatitis B surface                  antigen (HBsAg), or chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, as evidenced by a                  positive test for HCV RNA. Subjects with a positive test for HCV antibody and a                  negative test for HCV RNA are eligible.               2. Documented virologic failure to >1 cART regimen.               3.

But cART can lose effectiveness and cause permanent side effects. If      treatment stops, HIV levels go up again. Researchers want to see if a new product can control      HIV levels when a person is off cART.      Objective:      - To see if the new product VRC01 is safe and can control the HIV level in the blood when a      person is not taking cART.      Eligibility:      - Adults ages 18-65 with HIV who are willing to interrupt their treatment for at least 24      weeks.      Design:        -  Participants will be screened with:        -  Physical exam        -  Medical history        -  Heart tests        -  Blood and urine tests.        -  Their HIV drugs may be switched. They will keep taking them until a few days after Visit           1.        -  Visit 1: Repeat screening procedures.        -  Participants will also have genetic testing and leukapheresis. For this, blood will be           removed through a needle in one arm and circulated through a machine that removes white           blood cells. The rest of the blood is returned through a needle in the other arm.        -  They will get the first study drug dose through a thin tube in an arm vein for about 1           hour.        -  For 24 weeks, participants will have 16 visits. They will have blood drawn every visit.           At some visits they will repeat the screening procedures and get another VRC01 dose.           They may have another leukapheresis.        -  Four weeks after the last dose, participants will restart their cART. For 20 weeks, they           will have monthly visits to repeat the screening procedures and discuss new symptoms.",HIV Neutralizing Antibodies;HIV Therapy;,Virus Diseases;Immune System Diseases;,C0019693;C0087111;C1547296,C0019693;C0087111;C1547296;C1522485;C0947630,C0220908;C0220908;C0220908;C0021051;C0262926;C0393006;C4553491;C0031809;C0023416;C0023416;C0877248;C0681520;C0681520;C0013893;C1263430;C0087111;C0018017;C0087111;C0226792;C0600109;C0027551;C0027551;C0013227;C0005767;C0018787;C0392366;C0005767;C0013227;C0005767;C0005767;C0005767;C0947630;C0005767;C1512346;C0013227;C0175730;C1550472;C0042789;C0042789;C0446516;C0446516;C1578513;C3539181;C1457887;C1512346;C1512346;C1512346;C1512346;C1512346;C0231530,C0021051,C0948762;C0427780;C1883256;C0027051;C0373595;C0033137;C0033137;C0019189;C0019189;C0021081;C0021051;C3858757;C3245491;C0001617;C0001617;C0018799;C0004764;C0032594;C0001617;C0019693;C0019693;C0920316;C0700589;C0700589;C0221829;C0021083;C0035150;C0035150;C0035150;C0033137;C0305065;C3813622;C0301625;C0033706;C0019163;C0042196;C0019163;C1521826;C0013227;C0376636;C0376636;C0007584;C0022885;C0518015;C0199176;C0199176;C1301725;C1516879;C1516879;C0006826;C1516879;C0011603;C0030547;C1516879;C0006826;C0009450;C0199230;C0087111;C0199230;C0199230;C0032961;C0021485;C0032961;C0237607;C0009450;C0199230;C0021400;C0012634;C1555587;C1555587;C3272565;C0549206;C1446409;C1446409;C1446409;C0003241;C0205160;C0443343;C0600109;C0392366;C1556133;C1706912;C0021102;C0040808;C0087111;C0021461;C0087111;C0262926;C0221423;C0001962;C0204695;C0032105;C1553386;C3810851;C0025663;C0700287;C0002962;C0205082;C0718247;C0006141;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C1551040;C0019168;C0947630;C0028429;C0018787;C0947630;C0947630;C0392366;C0392366;C0392366;C0392366;C1561543;C0013227;C1114365;C0009253;C0012634;C0015502;C0237607;C4699618;C0032181;C0677505;C1552867;C3245501;C0242781;C3840693;C3840693;C3827727;C4082977;C4684637;C1518681;C3842337;C3842337;C1320102;C1697779;C1550043;C0022885;C3843422;C1522449;C0236175;C4699274;C1511790;C1511790;C0804815;C0332534;C4055646;C1706074;C1561542;C1512793;C1512793;C4331837;C1512793;C4331837;C4331837;C0018792;C4331837;C4331837;C4331837;C0233601;C4331837;C4284141;C1444662;C0042210;C1555587;C4283785;C4086490;C1548573;C4086490;C4086490;C3272565;C0599990;C4699190;C1140618;C1441829;C4698129,C0087111,20170407,40.0,280.0,Completed,27959728,80,80.0,0.03022330994468,0.027844737534495,"Age 18-65 years old.;;;;;;;;;;HIV-1 infection and clinically stable.;;;;;;;;;;In general good health and with an identified primary health care provider for                  medical management of HIV infection and willing to maintain a relationship with a                  primary health care provider for medical management of HIV infection while                  participating in the study.;;;;;;;;;;CD4+ cell count >450 cells/mm^3 at screening.;;;;;;;;;;Documentation of continuous cART treatment with suppression of plasma viral level                  below the limit of detection for greater than or equal to 3 years.

It will also monitor participants for the social impact of being      in an HIV vaccine study (e.g., problems with insurance, health care, friends, family,      employment, housing, and so forth). The vaccines are VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP (called the DNA      vaccine) and VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP (called the rAd vaccine). The DNA vaccine codes for four HIV      proteins. The rAd vaccine is made using an adenovirus (a common virus that causes upper      respiratory infections, such as the common cold) that has been modified to contain DNA that      codes for three HIV proteins. These vaccines cannot cause HIV or adenoviral infections.      The study will also see if the vaccines cause an immune response; if the injection of the DNA      vaccine given using a needle and syringe is similar in safety and immune response to giving      them with a needleless injection device called a Biojector 2000; if people who already have      antibodies to adenovirus still have an immune response to rAd vaccine; and if there are      social harms that result from participating in an HIV vaccine study.      Healthy volunteers between 18 and 50 years of age may be eligible for this 42-week study.      Candidates are screened with a medical history, physical examination, blood and urine tests      (including pregnancy test for women), and questions regarding sexual behavior and other      practices.      Participants receive three injections (shots) of the DNA vaccine and one injection of the rAd      vaccine. All injections are given into a muscle in the upper arm (alternating right and left      arms with each injection), using a needle and syringe or the needleless Biojector 2000. The      first vaccination is given the day of enrollment into the study, and the DNA vaccinations are      given about 4 weeks apart from each other, with a minimum of 21 days between injections. The      rAd ""booster""vaccination is given at Week 24. Participants fill out a diary card at home for      5 days after each vaccination, recording their temperature and any symptoms. They come to the      clinic for follow-up 3 days each DNA vaccine injection, and call or return again 7 days after      each injection. They call a study nurse 1 or 2 days after the rAd injection.      There are 15 to 18 clinic visits during the course of the study. At each visit, participants      are checked for health changes or problems. Blood and urine samples are collected at some      visits. Participants are periodically tested for HIV and asked questions about their sexual      behavior and drug use and are counseled throughout the study on HIV risk reduction.

The current rule for starting treatment of HIV infection is to combine members from different      classes of anti-HIV drugs, such as 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and      either a PI or a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). However, these      combinations can be complicated and difficult to take, can cause a number of side effects,      and may become ineffective. Combinations that are simpler, better tolerated, and more      effective are needed. Because PIs can cause long-term side effects and because HIV can become      resistant to many of them at the same time, anti-HIV combination treatments that do not use      PIs are being tested.","HIV-1;Didanosine;Drug Therapy, Combination;Zidovudine;Nevirapine;Stavudine;Lamivudine;RNA, Viral;Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors;Anti-HIV Agents;Viral Load;Combivir;BMS 232632;Efavirenz;Treatment Naive;",Virus Diseases;Bacterial Infections and Mycoses;Immune System Diseases;,C0033607;C0019693;C0087111;C0882214,C0033607;C0019693;C0087111;C0456909;C0040808;C3897779;C0882214,C0282519;C0282519;C0033607;C4553491;C0019693;C3539181;C0877248;C0877248;C0087111;C3242385;C0087111;C3242385;C0087111;C0332218;C0456387;C0392366;C0947630;C0013227;C0870077;C3811910;C3539181;C3539181;C4684765;C1514892;C0034770,C0021051,C1535939;C0427780;C0013230;C3536994;C0813171;C0700589;C0064113;C0022625;C0033493;C0701159;C0013216;C0064113;C0013227;C0085173;C0039736;C0376705;C0002598;C0085170;C0032952;C3714514;C3714514;C0072916;C0026056;C0034414;C0040879;C0221423;C0087111;C0221423;C0087111;C0012634;C0140575;C1446409;C0723457;C0549206;C0005116;C0035608;C0042210;C0025663;C0204695;C0018270;C0001962;C1552867;C0006141;C0439662;C0027651;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0013227;C3641827;C0947630;C0947630;C0013227;C0947630;C0013227;C0013227;C0947630;C0304712;C0013227;C0947630;C0013227;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0013227;C0947630;C1299581;C3248622;C1550655;C1550655;C3245501;C3842337;C3842337;C1561542;C1706074;C4331837;C0944911;C4331837;C4331837;C4331837;C4331837;C4086490;C4283785;C3843408,C0087111;C0282519,20050601,,,Completed,24979445;24326304;20121419;20102271;16905783,206,41.2,0.026605520479423,0.026054964267749,"Are HIV-positive.;;;;;;;;;;Have a viral load of at least 400 copies/ml within 90 days prior to study entry.;;;;;;;;;;Are at least 16 years old.;;;;;;;;;;Weigh at least 40 kg.;;;;;;;;;;Have a negative pregnancy test within 48 hours before starting study drugs, if female             and able to have children.;;;;;;;;;;Agree to use 2 effective methods of birth control while taking, and for 3 months after             stopping, the study medications.;;;;;;;;;;Provide written consent of a parent or guardian, if under 18 years of age.","Have taken anti-HIV drugs in the past.;;;;;;;;;;Are allergic to any of the study drugs or ingredients.;;;;;;;;;;Are pregnant or breast-feeding.;;;;;;;;;;Have taken any of the following drugs within 14 days prior to study entry: amiodarone,             astemizole, bepridil, cisapride, ergot or ergot derivatives, systemic itraconazole,             systemic ketoconazole, midazolam, propoxyphene, quinidine, rifampin, terfenadine,             thalidomide, triazolam, or St. John's wort.;;;;;;;;;;Have taken drugs that influence the immune system, HIV or other vaccines, or             investigational drugs within 30 days prior to study entry.

Visceral fat can cause health problems like heart or liver disease. Researchers      want to see if a blood pressure drug can help by blocking a hormone in the body.      Objective:      To see if eplerenone reduces fat stored in the heart muscle and liver in people with HIV and      increased visceral fat.      Eligibility:      Adults ages 18 75 with HIV and increased waist circumference. Increased waist circumference      is defined as more than 40 inches in men and more than 35 inches in women.      Design:      Participants will be screened with:      Physical exam      Medical history      Blood tests      Measurements of hips, waist, legs, arms, shoulders, and neck      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. They will lie on a table that slides into a machine.      Electrocardiogram (EKG) to measure heart electrical activity      Transient elastography, a special ultrasound to measure liver tissue stiffness      A small piece their liver collected (optional)      Participants will have a baseline visit:      Physical exam      Medical history      Blood tests      DEXA scan to measure body fat, muscle mass, and bone density. Participants will lie on a      table while a very small dose of x-rays goes through the body.      Resting energy expenditure (REE). This measures the amount of oxygen breathed in and carbon      dioxide breathed out.      Participants will get a 1-week supply of eplerenone. They will take one pill per day.      Participants will have a follow-up visit 1 week later. They will have:      Physical exam      Medical history      Blood tests      23-week supply of eplerenone      Participants will have 5 more follow-up visits.

This study looks for combinations of anti-HIV drugs (""cocktails"") which will be the most      effective with the fewest problems.",HIV Protease Inhibitors;Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors;Anti-HIV Agents;Viral Load;,Virus Diseases;Bacterial Infections and Mycoses;Immune System Diseases;,C0019693;C0013227;C0220825;C0947630;C3811910,C3537103;C0033607;C0019693;C0087111;C0947630;C1554184,C3540029;C4553491;C3539181;C0877248;C1299586;C3539181;C0920551;C0012133;C0525005;C0209738;C0043474;C0237607;C0164662;C0674428;C1446409;C1552740;C0086960;C3843801;C0947630;C0013227;C0013227;C0947630;C0013227;C0012133;C0164662;C0209738;C0043474;C1550655;C0033213,C0021051,C1524095;C0282519;C1535939;C1535939;C0029118;C0019348;C0949266;C0677881;C1963724;C0013230;C0031117;C0031117;C0020557;C0009905;C0009905;C0033607;C0677908;C0006852;C0239126;C0003308;C1115771;C0687133;C3536994;C0282515;C0282515;C0282515;C0008281;C0036220;C0969677;C0401151;C0020517;C1515119;C0003289;C0813171;C0242402;C0085421;C0001617;C0002199;C0242297;C0267797;C0001551;C1514463;C0019993;C0740858;C0014822;C0008286;C0055856;C1705425;C0028756;C0008350;C0008402;C0014822;C4553491;C0700589;C4553491;C0002600;C0006949;C0008296;C0033308;C0028420;C0031412;C0001645;C0042291;C0006405;C0085762;C0175631;C0019693;C0580327;C0052796;C0064113;C0357126;C0357131;C0003419;C0039601;C0042196;C0022625;C0286651;C0528023;C0012702;C0014806;C0064113;C0022625;C0033405;C0035648;C0030305;C0033493;C0030305;C0022625;C0033493;C0022625;C0064113;C0003232;C0013227;C0013227;C0013227;C0013227;C0013227;C0013227;C0013227;C0002144;C0008174;C0011685;C0082608;C0064636;C0030873;C0033497;C0074554;C0013227;C0013227;C0030863;C0013227;C0002144;C0394664;C0013227;C0013227;C0017066;C0033429;C0085173;C0030863;C0013227;C0085173;C0030863;C0042196;C0013227;C0007584;C0138547;C0138547;C0210630;C0278329;C0002771;C0138547;C0376705;C0220825;C0002333;C0008783;C0009002;C0016365;C0016375;C0020934;C0024027;C0025887;C0068485;C0028066;C0529793;C1301725;C1301725;C1516879;C0025519;C0006826;C0013227;C0002598;C0085170;C0016229;C0038633;C1301725;C0013227;C0002598;C0085170;C0138547;C3714514;C0013227;C0680532;C0680532;C0087111;C0025175;C0087111;C0680532;C0085208;C0009079;C0012373;C0085251;C0014892;C0014939;C0022209;C0022860;C0023660;C0031507;C0039468;C0025605;C0680532;C0087111;C0680532;C0750484;C0750484;C0680532;C0680532;C0680532;C3864998;C0012634;C0680532;C0087111;C0072916;C0026056;C0034414;C0035525;C0040879;C0140575;C0140575;C0087111;C0140575;C0042874;C0042874;C0087111;C0072916;C0026056;C0034414;C0040879;C0680532;C0140575;C0026056;C0680532;C0140575;C0009450;C0680532;C0009450;C0009450;C0221423;C1619636;C0442711;C0442711;C0733468;C0442711;C0042890;C0012010;C0026549;C0029997;C0033487;C0043031;C0078839;C0274281;C1272835;C3245501;C2707008;C1552740;C0005116;C0235195;C0031935;C0035608;C0035608;C0235195;C2707008;C0332149;C0020517;C0000975;C0025663;C0038351;C0009214;C0010980;C0242402;C0040132;C0333052;C1547296;C3245509;C0017237;C0687696;C0262512;C0687697;C0087111;C0221423;C0087111;C0221423;C0087111;C0221423;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0700704;C0700004;C0032105;C0025663;C0032105;C0032105;C4521152;C0376667;C0301571;C0015733;C0037313;C0947630;C0947630;C0013227;C0013227;C0947630;C1510438;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0013227;C0304712;C0304712;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0013227;C0947630;C0304712;C0947630;C0947630;C1547229;C0947630;C1547229;C0947630;C0947630;C1317574;C1273517;C0230463;C1704326;C1317574;C1273517;C1550472;C0012133;C0012133;C0042789;C0012133;C1561538;C0008310;C0087111;C2945673;C0012634;C0012634;C3540777;C2349988;C3841442;C0033213;C1550655;C1550655;C1550655;C1552867;C1550655;C1552867;C1550655;C1550655;C1550655;C1588883;C3245501;C0949466;C0219461;C3842337;C3842337;C0233492;C1518681;C3842337;C4684637;C3842337;C3842337;C3842337;C0218640;C0022885;C0022885;C3714738;C4054353;C0282519;C0169964;C0599918;C0018494;C3537104;C1706074;C1706074;C1706074;C0441229;C4331837;C4331837;C4331837;C4331837;C4331837;C4331837;C4331837;C4331837;C4331837;C4331837;C4331837;C4331837;C0857490;C0606968;C0235032;C0033308;C4699275;C0001962;C0006353;C1548573;C2346845;C3245501;C3245501;C0939261;C3843408;C3834249;C0033621;C3834249;C0282547;C0599990;C4699193,C0030946;C0282519,20021101,,,Completed,24326304;20467286,42,21.0,0.025028253469511,0.023277849584553,"Chemoprophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia if CD4+ cell count is less than or             equal to 200 cells/mm3.]        [Suggested as an alternative agent for chemoprophylaxis against Mycobacterium avium        complex:;;;;;;;;;;Azithromycin.]        [Allowed: AS PER AMENDMENT 7/5/00:;;;;;;;;;;Topical and oral antifungal agents.

What is the optimal intervention for the prevention of antepartum and intrapartum           transmission of HIV?        2. What is the optimal intervention for the prevention of postpartum transmission in           breastfeeding (BF) infants?        3. What is the optimal intervention for the preservation of maternal health after the risk           period for prevention of mother-to-child-transmission ends (either at delivery or           cessation of BF)?      The overall PROMISE protocol had three separate interventional components to address each of      these three questions and was conducted at locations in Africa and other parts of the world.      Due to variations in the standard of care for HIV-infected pregnant and postpartum women and      their infants at different sites, not all of these questions were relevant. Therefore, two      separate versions of the PROMISE protocol were developed, each containing only the relevant      components. The 1077BF protocol was used at sites where the standard method of infant feeding      was breastfeeding, whereas the 1077FF protocol was used at sites where the standard method of      infant feeding was formula feeding.

More and more evidence show that PWD are more likely to be poor, vulnerable to physical and      sexual violence, and to have less access to education. Therefore, PWD are likely to have an      increased risk for HIV infection, potentially being a key population in regard to this      epidemic.      The vulnerability of PWD was recognized in 2007 by the United Nations Convention on the      Rights of Persons with Disabilities. However, data on the extent how PWD are affected by HIV      is still very limited. As a result, PWD are usually overlooked by National AIDS Control      Programmes and few projects specifically targeting them have been developed.      Recognizing the need for appropriate and reliable data to help protect the rights of PWD and      achieve a better inclusion of disability in National AIDS Control Programmes, the Institute      of Research for Development (IRD), the Institut de Formation et Recherche Demographique      (IFORD) and Handicap International (HI) propose this study that aims to provide quantitative      and qualitative data on the vulnerability of PWD to HIV infection in Cameroon and Burkina      Faso, in order to define if this vulnerable population is also a Key Population in relation      to the HIV epidemic.
