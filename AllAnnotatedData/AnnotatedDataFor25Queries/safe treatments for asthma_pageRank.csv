Exclusion Criteria for Randomization At the end of the run-in period, a subject will not be        eligible to enter the treatment period of the study if they meet any of the following        criteria.          1. Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities: Clinically significant abnormal laboratory tests             during Visit 1 which are still abnormal upon repeat analysis and are not believed to             be due to disease(s) present. Each Investigator will use his/her own discretion in             determining the clinical significance of the abnormality. When in doubt,             GlaxoSmithKline, or designee, should be notified so that a joint decision can be made.          2. Changes in asthma medication (excluding albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol             provided at Visit 1).          3. Occurrence of a culture-documented or suspected bacterial or viral infection of the             upper or lower respiratory tract, sinus or middle ear during the run-in period that             led to a change in asthma management, or in the opinion of the Investigator is             expected to affect the subjects asthma status or the subjects ability to participate             in the study.          4. Asthma exacerbation, defined as any worsening of asthma requiring any treatment other             than rescue albuterol/salbutamol or regular inhaled corticosteroid use. This includes             requiring the use of systemic corticosteroids and / or emergency room visit or             hospitalization or a change in subject's regular inhaled corticosteroid dose.          5. A subject will not be eligible for randomization if he/she has an abnormal visual             oropharyngeal exam at the randomization Visit 3 (visual clinical evidence of oral             candidiasis).          6. Non-compliance with completion of the Daily Diary, defined as: -Completion of AM and             PM symptom scores on less than 4 days out of the last 7 days immediately preceding             Visit 3.

People of all ages in countries throughout the      world are affected by this chronic airway disorder that can be severe and sometimes fatal.      The prevalence of asthma is increasing everywhere, especially among children.According to      international guidelines, once control of asthma is achieved and maintained for at least 3      months, a gradual reduction of the maintenance therapy should be tried in order to identify      the minimum therapy required to maintain control. This will help reduce the risk of side      effects and enhance patient adherence to the treatment plan.      Reduction of therapy in patients on combination therapy should begin with a reduction in the      dose of inhaled glucocorticosteroid.1 The present study is designed to evaluate if patients      with controlled asthma treated with FP 1000 mcg + salmeterol 100 mcg daily can be stepped      down. Stepping-down will be attempted with two medications: a new combination of extrafine      beclomethasone dipropionate 400 mcg + formoterol 24 mcg daily (test medication, Foster™) and,      alternatively, fluticasone propionate 500 mcg + salmeterol 100 mcg daily(reference      medication) without losing asthma control.If this hypothesis will be confirmed, the present      study will demonstrate that asthma control can be maintained with less than half the dose of      inhaled corticosteroid and with less medical costs.      Given the aims of this study, the population to be monitored includes adult patients with      moderate persistent asthma, which can be defined controlled according to the current      guidelines under standard stabilised treatment. The intended treatment duration is therefore      designed to ensure that good control of asthma is firmly achieved before stepping down the      treatment (8 weeks run-in period), but also that the condition of the patients are followed      long enough (24 weeks comparative treatment period) to ensure that a new stable condition is      also obtained and properly monitored.",Asthma;Stepdown;Beclomethasone;Formoterol;Corticosteroids;,Immune System Diseases;Respiratory Tract Diseases;,C0004906;C0117996;C1096775;C0060657;C0073992;C0087111;C0004096,C0004906;C0117996;C0245531;C1096775;C2911690;C0060657;C2911690;C0087111;C4554418;C1130494;C0718247;C1553480;C0004096;C1705425;C1561557;C0013227;C1550655,C0004906;C0117996;C0677908;C0009429;C0599880;C0001617;C0013227;C0162791;C0073992;C0060657;C0013227;C0073992;C0013227;C0162791;C4551656;C1293152;C4551656;C0750484;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0012634;C0087111;C0012634;C0012634;C3245501;C2828392;C1551357;C0427149;C0033213;C0087111;C0087111;C0004048;C0150312;C0150312;C0004048;C0004096;C0178987;C0205082;C0004096;C0004096;C0004096;C0004096;C0004096;C0004096;C0004096;C0025344;C0025344;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C1552861;C0392366;C1578513;C0600140;C1578513;C3539181;C1518681;C4684637;C2911690;C2911690;C3858576;C0332534;C1561542;C1706074;C1522411;C0931554;C0221106;C0030695;C0030695;C0220825;C0427149;C1547226;C0332155;C0546816;C4698129;C1304888,C0004096,C0024117;C0026457;C0030735;C0003290;C0595726;C0010054;C0740858;C0003811;C0004364;C0948807;C0011849;C0026946;C0242896;C0008679;C0001617;C0019993;C0001617;C0020550;C3245491;C0019590;C0004239;C0018801;C0020538;C0489625;C0232197;C0041296;C0030920;C0082607;C0018827;C0428977;C0018827;C0231199;C0162791;C0073992;C0013227;C0013227;C0162791;C0021308;C1704788;C0199230;C0011900;C0087111;C0700287;C0087111;C0087111;C0750484;C0282443;C0024109;C0011900;C0009450;C0024109;C0033325;C0087111;C0199230;C4684790;C3272565;C0004271;C0031843;C0205161;C1704632;C0443343;C0012634;C4699613;C0333052;C0392366;C0337664;C0337664;C0262512;C0262926;C0178987;C0262926;C0262926;C0020517;C0025344;C0004096;C1553386;C0025344;C0025344;C0004096;C0004096;C0004096;C0205082;C0871269;C0018792;C0018792;C0542560;C0006826;C0025344;C0004096;C0947630;C0376660;C0376660;C0699809;C1546725;C0028778;C0947630;C0013227;C0947630;C0030735;C1561540;C0018026;C1561543;C1968515;C2936173;C0392366;C0024109;C0013227;C0013227;C0600140;C0600140;C0600140;C1561538;C1578513;C0600140;C1306036;C0001645;C0231221;C2707256;C1550655;C1457887;C1457887;C1457887;C1457887;C1550655;C1550655;C1550655;C1550655;C0080194;C2707261;C0237677;C4684637;C4684637;C1320102;C1320102;C0015272;C2911690;C2911690;C4319730;C2911690;C4086268;C4086268;C3272565;C1561542;C1706074;C1561542;C1561542;C1512346;C1512346;C1512346;C4281788;C0559897;C1547226;C4283785;C4086490;C0332155;C0332155;C4698437;C0546816,,20100301,,,Completed,22731754,9,9.0,0.014234799798519,0.019645286257393,"Patients will be enrolled for screening at Visit 1 into the run-in period if they meet             all the following criteria:;;;;;;;;;;Clinical diagnosis of moderate persistent asthma for at least 6 months, according to             GINA revised version 2005 guidelines 1 and considering current treatment;;;;;;;;;;;Forced expiratory volume (FEV1) or peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) ΓëÍ 80% of the             predicted normal value;;;;;;;;;;;Treated with fluticasone 1000 mcg + salmeterol 100 mcg daily for at least 4 weeks at a             stable dose;;;;;;;;;;;Reporting no nocturnal symptoms or awakenings, no exacerbations, no limitations of             activities, symptoms in ΓëÁ2 days and use of rescue medication ΓëÁ2 days per week, in the             last 4 weeks;;;;;;;;;;;Exhibiting a co-operative attitude and ability to be trained to correctly use the             study devices and to complete the diary cards.

A serum pregnancy test             is required for females of childbearing potential at the initial Screening Visit             (Visit 1) and Visit 5 or Early Withdrawal          4. Severity of Disease: A best FEV1 of 40%-90% of the predicted normal value at the Visit             1, Screening visit. Predicted values will be based upon NHANES III using the             adjustment for Asians [Hankinson, 2010].          5. Reversibility of Disease: Demonstrated ≥12% and ≥200mL reversibility of FEV1 within             10-40minutes following 2-4 inhalations of albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol (or             one nebulised treatment with albuterol/salbutamol solution) at the Screening Visit.          6. Current Anti-Asthma Therapy: All subjects must be using an ICS, with or without LABA,             for at least 12 weeks prior to Visit 1, in accordance with the protocol defined             acceptable dose ranges.          7. Short-Acting Beta2-Agonists: All subjects must be able to replace their current             short-acting beta2-agonists with albuterol/salbutamol inhaler at Visit 1 for use as             needed for the duration of the study.

A common type of inhaler is called a      'beta-agonist' (e.g. salbutamol). They improve asthma symptoms by stimulating areas in the      airway causing it to widen. Although these drugs are useful short term, long term use can      make asthma worse in some people.      'Beta-blockers' are the complete opposite type of medication. Just now they are avoided in      patients with asthma. Beta-blockers cause problems in asthmatics in the short term, including      severe asthma attacks.      The other mainstay of inhaler treatment for asthma is inhaled steroid or 'preventer'      medication. These work by dampening down the inflammation in the lungs that occurs in asthma.      New research has suggested that longer term use of beta-blockers can also reduce airway      inflammation which may improve asthma control. This research was done in asthmatic patients      who didn't need inhaled steroids to control their asthma. At the moment the investigators are      studying to see if there is a benefit of beta-blocker use for asthma over and above      asthmatics own usual doses of inhaled steroids.      In this study, the investigators will be trying to find out if adding a beta blocker to a      smaller dose of steroid inhaler has the same effect on asthma control as just using a higher      dose of steroid inhaler by itself.",Asthma;Propranolol;Inhaled corticosteroids;Steroid sparing agent;Airway hyper-responsiveness;,Immune System Diseases;Respiratory Tract Diseases;,C0001645;C1547226;C0087111;C1547225;C0004096,C0001645;C0220825;C1547226;C0038317;C0087111;C0458827;C1547311;C1547225;C0241526;C0004096,C0347950;C0021368;C0021368;C0001645;C0001645;C0001927;C0013227;C0004096;C0013227;C0004096;C0087111;C0004096;C0021461;C0038317;C0038317;C0021461;C2987634;C0021461;C0004048;C0038317;C0004048;C0004048;C0038317;C0021461;C0038317;C0021461;C0004096;C3245511;C0004096;C0178987;C0004096;C0004096;C0205082;C0004096;C0004096;C0178987;C0004096;C0004096;C0004096;C1518681;C0004096;C0013227;C1457868;C0024109;C0947630;C0042789;C0001645;C1457887;C0033213;C0184511;C0184511;C0776963;C0001645;C0001645;C0013227;C4283785,C0035228,C0001617;C0232201;C0018794;C0013227;C0018810;C0278329;C0202070;C0032961;C0004048;C1547311;C0004096;C0004096;C0004096;C0018787;C0947630;C1561538;C1457887;C4086268;C0043084;C1561542;C1547226;C1995642;C0332535,C0241526;C3653466,20130525,,,Completed,28065396;24938324,6,3.0,0.015708184783396,0.017378819469266997,Stable mild to moderate asthma;;;;;;;;;;Histamine PC20 </= 8mg/ml;;;;;;;;;;Receiving inhaled corticosteroid 0-1000ug daily (BDP equivalent dose);;;;;;;;;;FEV1 > 60% predicted;;;;;;;;;;Diurnal variability < 30%;;;;;;;;;;Reliever use </= 8puffs/day;;;;;;;;;;ECG demonstrating sinus rhythm,Uncontrolled symptoms of asthma;;;;;;;;;;Systolic BP<110mmHg;;;;;;;;;;Heart rate<60bpm;;;;;;;;;;Pregnancy or lactation;;;;;;;;;;Heart block;;;;;;;;;;Heart rate limiting medications currently prescribed;;;;;;;;;;Asthma exacerbation within 6 months of study commencement

If female, must have a negative urine pregnancy test.          9. Patient has a pre-study medical history, physical examination, 12-Lead ECG, and safety             laboratory test results within normal reference ranges or clinically acceptable to the             Investigator.         10. Patient is a non-smoker for at least 6 months before Screening (Visit 1) and has a <             10 pack/year history of smoking.         11. Patient is medically stable for at least 8 weeks before Randomization (Visit 2), and             the Investigator does not consider study participation to place the patient at             increased risk of AEs (with the exception of possible asthma exacerbations).         12. Patient is able and willing to give written informed consent.        Exclusion Criteria:          1. Patient has a current diagnosis of respiratory disorder other than asthma (e.g.,             chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, emphysema, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease             [COPD], etc).          2. Patient has received oral corticosteroid treatment within 8 weeks of Randomization             (Visit 2)or patient has been intubated for ventilation in the past 5 years.          3. Patient has used any leukotriene antagonist within 1 week before Screening (Visit 1)             or anti-IgE medications within 4 weeks of Screening (Visit 1).          4. Female patient is pregnant, breastfeeding, or not using an adequate method of             contraception.          5. Patient has a clinically relevant medical history of very severs asthma that would             preclude steroid reduction or sufficient compliance with the protocol.          6. Patient uses concomitant medications, including herbal, over-the-counter, or             prescription medicines that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may affect the             outcome of study endpoints and/or well-being of the patient.          7. Patient has a history of alcohol or substance abuse within 2 years of Screening (Visit             1).          8. Patient consumes more than 28 units (male) or 21 units (female) of alcohol a week             (unit = 1 glass of wine = 1measure of spirits = ½ pint or 8 fluid ounces of beer).          9. Patient cannot communicate reliably with the Investigator or is unlikely to cooperate             with the requirements of the study.         10. Patient has previously taken AEROVANT™ or another formulation of AER 001 (e.g., BAY             16-9996, pitrakinra).         11.

Subjects must be on doses equivalent to 7.5 - 40 mg/day of             prednisolone/prednisone at Visit 1 and be on a stable dose for at least 2 weeks prior             to randomization. Patients must agree to switch to study required             prednisone/prednisolone as their oral corticosteroid for the duration of the study.          7. Patients with documented failures of OCS reduction within 6 months prior to Visit 1             will not be required to proceed through the dose optimization phase during run-in.          8.

In the US, impoverished children and children from minority ethnic and racial      backgrounds suffer disproportionately from asthma. While National Heart, Lung, and Blood      Institute (NHLBI) guidelines recommend daily preventive medications for all children with      mild persistent to severe persistent asthma, studies indicate that many children in the US      who should receive preventive medications are not receiving them. The overall goal of this      project is to target an ethnically diverse population of inner-city schoolchildren with      asthma and explore a school-based program to reduce asthma morbidity. We hypothesize that      children receiving a comprehensive school-based intervention will experience less      asthma-related morbidity compared to children receiving usual care. Our comprehensive      school-based intervention consists of both administration of recommended preventive asthma      medications in school (with dose adjustments according to NHLBI guidelines) and an      environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) reduction program in the home for smoke-exposed children.      Our secondary hypothesis is that, among the subgroup of smoke-exposed children, those who      receive the school-based intervention with ETS reduction will experience less asthma      morbidity than those who receive usual care.",Asthma;,Immune System Diseases;Respiratory Tract Diseases;,C4553491;C0087111;C0441767;C0004096;C0947630,C4553491;C0087111;C0441767;C0004096;C0947630,C0679800;C0679800;C0679800;C0008679;C0019993;C1533734;C0013227;C0013227;C0013227;C2945673;C0162791;C0237607;C0162791;C0237607;C0220880;C0220880;C4551656;C0027627;C4551656;C0220880;C0947630;C0004096;C3245511;C0680174;C0683278;C0004096;C0205082;C0004096;C0004096;C0004096;C0004096;C0004096;C0004096;C0018787;C0005767;C0024109;C0018017;C0180799;C0233492;C0729829;C0337664;C0337664;C0337664;C0221106;C0546816;C0546816;C0220644;C4700170,C0004096,C0026884;C0009861;C0886296;C0184661;C0580718;C0681405;C0162340;C0031809;C0804815;C0011900;C0004096;C0205082;C0004096;C1519316;C0004096;C0004096;C1547225;C3262831;C0012634;C0038951;C0233492;C1524004;C0804815;C4086544;C1561542;C0546816;C0546816;C3845379,C0004096,20120101,0.0,1060.0,Completed,23400614,9,9.0,0.017454796819604,0.015920254765549,Physician-diagnosed asthma;;;;;;;;;;Mild persistent to severe persistent asthma;;;;;;;;;;Ages 3-10 years;;;;;;;;;;Attending school in the Rochester City School District preschools or elementary             schools;;;;;;;;;;Signed physician permission to enroll the child;;;;;;;;;;Parent or caregiver must consent to the intervention,Inability to speak and understand either English or Spanish;;;;;;;;;;No access to a working phone for follow-up surveys;;;;;;;;;;The family planning to leave the school district within fewer than 6 months;;;;;;;;;;The child having other significant medical conditions that could interfere with the             assessment of asthma-related outcome measures;;;;;;;;;;children in foster care or other situations in which consent cannot be obtained from a             guardian;;;;;;;;;;Current participation in other local asthma interventions

About 10% of children are affected.      Not surprisingly, acute asthma exacerbations are one of the common reasons to visit pediatric      emergency rooms (ER). About 5.7% of all pediatric emergency room visits are due to acute      asthma exacerbation. Around 8% of those get admitted to the hospital. This constitutes huge      financial and administrative burden on the health care system.      Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) is the gold standard prophylactic therapy for patients with      persistent asthma. In the setting of acute asthma exacerbation systemic steroids given early      in the course of treatment help decrease the rate of admission and return to the ER. However,      the anti-inflammatory action of corticosteroids, through which this effect is caused, takes 4      hours to start working. This is because it is mediated through genomic pathways where the      transcription of several inflammatory cytokines is suppressed. It was also shown that      corticosteroids can cause vasoconstriction through non-genomic pathways. The onset of this      action is as quick as 30-60 minutes. It is proposed that this action is mediated by blocking      the extraneuronal uptake (metabolism) of norepinephrine in vascular smooth muscle cells,      hence, making it available for re-use by the sympathetic neuronal cells.      Our objective is to compare the efficacy of adding repetitive sequential doses of budesonide      versus placebo (normal saline (NS)) to β2-agonist and ipratropium bromide (IB) combination      (standard treatment) in the management of acute asthma in children in the ER. We hypothesize      that the addition of budesonide to β2-agonist and IB in the management of moderate to severe      acute asthma in the ER is superior to the addition of placebo.",,"Immune System Diseases;Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;Respiratory Tract Diseases;",C0001617;C0087111;C1546844;C0004048;C0004096,C0001617;C0087111;C1546844;C0004048;C0004096,C0349790;C0349790;C0349790;C0700580;C4684780;C0008679;C0001617;C0001617;C0001617;C0028351;C0445115;C0582415;C0582415;C0086388;C0025519;C0054201;C0376636;C0054201;C0376636;C1546399;C1546399;C1546457;C0087111;C0184666;C0018017;C0184666;C2828392;C0038317;C0005847;C0004048;C0087111;C0542559;C0032042;C0032042;C0004096;C3245511;C3245511;C0004096;C1518681;C0243144;C0205082;C1512346;C3244317;C1552850;C0018026;C1552861;C3539181;C0003209;C0442797;C3845829;C0009653;C0776963;C0442743;C1524094;C1512346;C0009813;C0127400;C0127400;C0233660;C1547226;C0886384;C0546816;C0220644;C0220644;C0220644,,C0746102;C0349790;C0349790;C0349790;C0018799;C0184661;C0011900;C0012634;C1697779;C0038317;C0150312;C0004096;C0205082;C0205082;C0004096;C0804815;C4699613;C1547226;C1547298,C1140111,20120401,56.0,3624.0,Completed,24384609,4,4.0,0.016628635259066004,0.015232806256914,Children 2-12 years of age with physician diagnosed asthma or a previous episode of             SOB that responded well to ╬▓2-agonists who present to the ER with moderate or severe             asthma exacerbation,Children with mild asthma exacerbation.;;;;;;;;;;Children with severe asthma exacerbation who are in critical condition or need             immediate intervention.;;;;;;;;;;Children who have heart disease or chronic lung disease other than asthma.;;;;;;;;;;Systemic steroids administered within the past 7 days.

Patients with asthma      frequently suffer from exacerbations, which can be triggered by allergens and, in particular,      viral respiratory infections. It has recently been shown that mepolizumab, a humanized      monoclonal antibody that neutralizes interleukin(IL)-5, markedly reduces the exacerbation      rate in asthma patients with eosinophilic airway inflammation. Previous studies have      indicated that in a mixed population (eosinophilic and non eosinophilic) of mild asthma      patients, mepolizumab did not have an impact on lung function and asthma symptom scores upon      allergen provocation, although it did on markers such as sputum and blood eosinophils.      Together, these observations led to the hypothesis that mepolizumab treatment reduces the      exacerbation rate by limiting virus-induced asthma exacerbations.      The investigators hypothesize that neutralization of IL-5 during virus infection in patients      with allergic asthma:        1. Reduces virus-induced bronchial inflammation        2. Attenuates virus-induced asthma symptoms, airflow limitation and bronchial           hyperresponsiveness.        3. Enhances cellular immune responses to the virus.      The aims of this study are to:        1. To investigate whether IL-5 neutralization reduces the inflammatory response to viral           airway infections in allergic asthma patients        2. To investigate whether IL-5 neutralization prevents or reduces asthma symptoms during           virus-induced asthma exacerbations        3. To investigate whether IL-5 neutralization affects the cellular immune response to viral           airway infections in allergic asthma patients",Asthma;Viral;Infection;Inflammation;Mepolizumab;Eosinophilia;,Immune System Diseases;Virus Diseases;Respiratory Tract Diseases;,C0969324;C0276447;C0087111;C0004096;C4086268,C0969324;C0276447;C0087111;C0004096;C4086268,C0035243;C1290884;C1155266;C0349790;C0349790;C0001883;C0042769;C0155877;C0155877;C0155877;C0035245;C0021368;C0700325;C0021368;C0969324;C0969324;C0969324;C0746619;C3714514;C3714514;C0087111;C0205039;C0205039;C0003241;C0178539;C0178539;C1704632;C0178987;C0947630;C1457887;C0231999;C0004096;C0043144;C0004096;C0683278;C0004096;C0178987;C0004096;C0004096;C0038056;C0004096;C0439662;C0178987;C0004096;C0439662;C0178987;C1185740;C0010200;C0005767;C0947630;C0042497;C1704632;C1578828;C1578828;C1578828;C1578828;C1457887;C1550655;C1457887;C1457887;C4086268;C0014457;C0014457;C0014457;C4086268;C0200638;C0005516;C0001721;C4086268;C0802014;C1512793;C1512793;C1512793;C3845941;C0032930;C3274161,C0012634,C0430056;C0013230;C0040808;C0220870;C1115771;C0232292;C0425310;C0001617;C0001617;C0430561;C0262926;C0024115;C0031809;C0857353;C1277691;C0013227;C0003241;C0805586;C0012833;C0087111;C0012634;C0087111;C0043144;C1446409;C1446409;C0150312;C0039070;C0549206;C1446409;C0262926;C0262512;C0038317;C0004048;C0262926;C1547296;C0012634;C0004096;C0004096;C0458827;C3245511;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0221232;C0229671;C1512346;C1512346;C0947630;C0947630;C1114365;C0036700;C4699604;C2826293;C1555707;C1457887;C4699613;C3166496;C1704258;C4684637;C0424093;C0057945;C4086268;C3272565;C2828358;C1706074;C1561542;C4331837;C4331837;C4331837;C1553756;C1968660;C0728774;C3272565;C4522152;C3272565;C4699193;C0546816,,20140301,,,Unknown status,30192638,1,1.0,0.015451924580898,0.01495138296164,"Age between 18 - 50 years;;;;;;;;;;History of episodic chest tightness and wheezing;;;;;;;;;;Intermittent or mild persistent asthma according to the criteria by the Global             Initiative for Asthma;;;;;;;;;;Non-smoking or stopped smoking more than 12 months ago and ΓëÁ 5 pack years (PY);;;;;;;;;;Clinically stable, no history of exacerbations within the last 6 weeks prior to the             study;;;;;;;;;;Steroid-na├»ve or those patients who are currently not on corticosteroids and have not             taken any corticosteroids by any dosing-routes within 2 weeks prior to the study.

A common inhaler used in asthma is called a      beta-agonist (for example salbutamol). They improve asthma symptoms by stimulating areas in      the human airway resulting in widening of the human airway. Although these drugs are useful      after the first dose, longterm use can cause worsening asthma symptoms.      Beta-blockers are the complete opposite type of medication. Just now they are avoided in      patients with asthma as after the first dose they can cause airway narrowing and cause an      asthma attack.      New research has suggested that long term use of beta-blockers can reduce airway inflammation      which can improve asthma control and improve symptoms.      This research was done in asthmatic patients who didn't need inhaled steroids to control      their asthma. What the investigators want to do is see if the same benefit of beta-blocker      use is asthma can be seen in people who take inhaled steroids.",,Immune System Diseases;Respiratory Tract Diseases;,C0087111;C0004096;C0001645,C0033497;C0220825;C2911690;C0087111;C0004096;C0001645,C0347950;C0021368;C0001645;C0001927;C0013227;C0004096;C0021461;C0038317;C0038317;C0021461;C2987634;C0004048;C0004048;C0004096;C3245511;C0004096;C0004096;C0178987;C0178987;C0004096;C0004096;C0178987;C0178987;C0004096;C0004096;C0004096;C0013227;C1273517;C0042789;C0001645;C1457887;C1457887;C1457887;C0184511;C0184511;C0184511;C0001645;C0013227;C4283785,C0004096,C1306036;C4050256;C0006265;C0349790;C0004905;C0005823;C0600370;C0018794;C0037981;C0013227;C0002598;C0032961;C0012634;C1547226;C0442711;C0442711;C2987634;C0006675;C0004096;C1547311;C0004096;C0725694;C0542560;C0947630;C0018787;C1547225;C1561540;C1561538;C3245491;C4553142;C1457887;C0237677;C4684637;C0004096;C0043084;C0745348;C1706074;C1561542;C4331837;C1995642;C0546816;C0019592,C1140111,20120301,,,Completed,26123421;23593932,23,11.5,0.020812181505736,0.014111374872819,"Male and female volunteers with stable mild intermittent or mild persistent asthma.;;;;;;;;;;Stable defined as: FEV1 (Forced Expiratory Volume in 1second) >80% predicted with             diurnal FEV1 variation <30% when LABA (Long Acting Beta Agonist) washed out.;;;;;;;;;;Methacholine PC20 <4mg/ml.;;;;;;;;;;Ability to perform spirometry, IOS (Impulse Oscillometry), bronchial challenge and all             domiciliary measurements.;;;;;;;;;;Ability to obtain Informed consent.;;;;;;;;;;Mild to Moderate Asthmatics taking ΓëÁ1000╬╝g BDP (Beclomethasone Diproprionate) per day             or equivalent.;;;;;;;;;;Withhold LABAs for 1 week prior to study.","Uncontrolled symptoms of asthma.;;;;;;;;;;Resting BP (Blood Pressure) <110 systolic or HR (Heart Rate)<60.;;;;;;;;;;Pregnancy or lactation.;;;;;;;;;;Known or suspected sensitivity to the IMP (Investigational Medicinal Product)(s).;;;;;;;;;;Inability to comply with protocol.;;;;;;;;;;Any degree of heart block.;;;;;;;;;;Rate limiting medication including ╬▓ blockers, rate limiting Calcium - Channel             Blockers and Amiodarone.;;;;;;;;;;Any other clinically significant medical condition that may either endanger the health             or safety of the participant, or jeopardise the protocol.;;;;;;;;;;An asthma exacerbation within the last 6 months."
