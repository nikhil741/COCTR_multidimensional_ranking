NCT01817998,0,Atrial Fibrillation (AF) and Physical Exercise,Role of Physical Exercise in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation.,Atrial Fibrillation;,Inclusion Criteria:          -  paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation documented on ECG          -  male and female of age 18 and above          -  written concent        Exclusion Criteria:          -  established permanent atrial fibrillation          -  language barrier          -  severe health conditions making physical exercise impossible or life expectancy             shorter than one year          -  signs of severe cardiac disease during inclusion tests,"Background and study concept:      Atrial fibrillation is the new global epidemic in cardiology. With improved survival from      other cardiovascular diseases and longer living in general, the incidence and prevalence of      AF rise dramatically in all developed countries with an estimated life time risk of one in      four for all people above the age of 40 years. Similarly in Denmark, the prevalence is      estimated to almost double within 2020. It is a fatal arrhythmia with doubled mortality      compared to patients with normal sinus rhythm; this primarily caused by an increased risk of      stroke and heart failure. In particular stroke is a feared complication with a 70% risk of      fatal outcome or lasting handicaps and immense costs for each patient as well as in terms of      health costs.      Moreover, many AF patients experience a variety of symptoms and have markedly reduced quality      of life. Opposed to heart failure patients and patients who have suffered from a myocardial      infarction, AF patients are not offered any sort of rehabilitation when diagnosed.      Pharmacological treatment of the arrhythmia is challenging. Most often, individual and      careful risk evaluation including ultrasound of the heart is obligatory to choose optimal      treatment strategy and prophylactic anticoagulation. In case a new anti-arrhythmic drug is      started to restore and maintain sinus rhythm, hospitalization for at least two days with      heart rhythm monitoring is required to detect any possible potentially dangerous or even      fatal arrhythmia as a side effect to the treatment. Additionally, the first new oral      anti-arrhythmic AF drug introduced for more than twenty-five years proved to be hazardous in      a high-risk AF population and is now only used with strict precautions.      To explore the role of alternative treatment strategies and to renew handling of cardiac      arrhythmia, we have therefore set out to study the role of physical exercise in AF patients.      Our specific study aims are to examine:        1. The effect of physical exercise on AF burden        2. The effect of physical exercise on the risk of cardiovascular hospitalization      Method:      Our study is an interventional, randomized exercise study. 60 patients older than 18 years      with ECG-documented AF will be included if written informed consent is obtained. They will be      randomized 1:1 to moderate-severe (80-85% of max capacity) or low intensity (50% of max      capacity) training. Exclusion criteria are language barrier, illness inherent with an      expected survival shorter than a year, other reasons preventing the patient from training,      revealed serious cardiac disease during pre-tests, AF ablation within one year, permanent AF.      Both groups are first participating in a nurse-led educational and care program. The program      is built on two individual consultations and one team consultation with focus on education in      AF.      The patients will be thoroughly examined before randomization and after ended training period      with special ultrasound of the heart, ECG-monitored test of maximal oxygen uptake on      ergometer bicycle, 24 hours measurement of blood pressure and pulse, and blood samples. They      will all be taught to use home ECG recorders, a new handheld device. The patients will send      ECG's twice daily and if the experience cardiac symptoms for 5 months (during exercise and      two months after).      When randomized the patients will be divided in teams of ten and trained on separate teams,      so the physiotherapist closely can guide the patients in training at the correct intensity      level.      Measurements:      During and after physical exercise the burden of atrial fibrillation is measured by tele-ECG      i.e. number of ECGs with atrial fibrillation divided by total number of ECGs. ECG reporting      begins after four weeks of physical exercise and continues 2 months after last training      session.      Recording of hospitalization begins after randomization and continues one year after last      training session. All hospitalizations caused by AF or related to the AF disease (relapse of      AF, heart failure, stroke, new anti-arrhythmic medication, elective electrical cardioversion,      complications to anticoagulation, pacemaker implantation) are recorded. Also, total days in      hospital are registered.      The AF population is growing on a global scale and the disease attracts immense interest on      all international cardiology congresses.

Surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation is a      technique used by surgeons to deaden atrial heart tissue and block electrical signals that      may be causing your heart to beat irregularly. There are no new procedures being tested in      this study; both mitral valve surgery and surgical ablation are used regularly in patients      who have mitral valve problems and atrial fibrillation, although no surgical ablation devices      have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of atrial      fibrillation. What is not known with certainty, is whether patients with atrial fibrillation      who are having planned mitral valve surgery would do better if they also had surgical      ablation rather than medication alone to treat their atrial fibrillation.","Mitral Valve Regurgitation;Mitral Valve Surgery;Mitral Valve Disease;Ablation, Catheter;Catheter Ablation, Radiofrequency;","Cardiovascular Diseases;Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;",C0004238;C0026264;C0543467;C0547070;C0543467;C0547070;C0543467;C1550655,C2585653;C0026264;C0543467;C0547070;C0543467;C0547070;C0543467;C1550655,C0004238;C0004238;C0004238;C0004238;C0004238;C1533734;C0026264;C0026264;C0026264;C0026264;C0232197;C0026264;C0013227;C0087111;C0547070;C0547070;C0543467;C0547070;C0547070;C0547070;C0547070;C0543467;C0543467;C0543467;C0543467;C0018792;C0392366;C0018792;C0018787;C0028778;C0018787;C0947630;C0439044;C1273517;C1273517;C0013227;C1578513;C0184661;C0086960;C0033213;C0087130;C1328018;C0543467;C0543467;C0543467;C0543467;C0543467;C4698437;C4082977,C1261287;C0018792;C1186983;C1186983;C0026266,C0542380;C0040961;C0240802;C0026265;C0026266;C0026266;C0162563;C0262926;C0262926;C0340517;C0003281;C0020550;C0878544;C0184633;C0700589;C0026264;C0003501;C0184661;C0026264;C0020564;C1561528;C0003489;C0376636;C0185792;C1301725;C1301725;C0031809;C1301725;C1301725;C0031809;C0684336;C0162340;C0376636;C1516879;C0184661;C0184661;C0009450;C3272565;C0543467;C0720099;C0150312;C0720099;C0150312;C0543467;C0549206;C2923685;C0030685;C0199168;C0543467;C0012634;C0030695;C0543467;C0087111;C0030650;C3244286;C3244286;C0871269;C0025344;C0184252;C0018787;C0947630;C1316572;C1551994;C1561543;C1561543;C1561543;C0013227;C1114365;C1301624;C0013798;C0013798;C0012634;C4684637;C4684637;C1320102;C2328206;C1705273;C0031843;C0332534;C1561542;C1561542;C4331837;C4331837;C1254223;C0018792;C1444662;C2707931;C0022116;C0022116;C0543467;C1334278;C4699193;C4699193;C4699193;C0546816,C0850292;C0026264;C1186983;C1186983;C0026266;C3494350,20150901,549.0,9360.0,Completed,25853744,38,38.0,0.005455044750157001,0.006571287333506,"Able to sign Informed Consent and Release of Medical Information forms;;;;;;;;;;Age ΓëÍ 18 years;;;;;;;;;;Clinical indications for mitral valve surgery for the following:;;;;;;;;;;Organic mitral valve disease; or;;;;;;;;;;Functional non-ischemic mitral regurgitation; or;;;;;;;;;;Ischemic mitral regurgitation with evidence of concomitant structural mitral                  valve disease        Note: May include need for surgical management of functional tricuspid regurgitation or        patent foramen ovale.

Currently decompensated heart failure","Study purpose The purpose of the study is to show that the addition of valsartan on top of      established therapies can reduce the recurrence of atrial fibrillation in patients with a      history of recent atrial fibrillation associated with cardiovascular diseases/comorbidities.      Primary objective To demonstrate that, in patients with history of recent atrial fibrillation      treated with the best recommended therapies, the addition of valsartan 320 mg is superior to      placebo in reducing atrial fibrillation recurrence.      Study design The GISSI-AF is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double blind, placebo      controlled study. Patients with a history of atrial fibrillation will be centrally randomized      in a 1:1 ratio to receive either valsartan or placebo.      GISSI-AF will be a pragmatic trial, with broad selection criteria to mimic real clinical      practice as much as possible. Since no special examinations or procedures are required for      the trial, the economic impact on the National Health Service will be minimized and use of      resources likely to be optimized. The enrollment period will last 12 months. The patients      will be followed up for 12 months from study entry      All prescribed treatments for AF or for the underlying cardiovascular diseases, including      ACE-inhibitors, amiodarone and betablockers, will be allowed:        -  patients should be on a stable treatment for at least one month        -  the current guideline for hypertension treatment should be applied        -  patients should not be started on ARBs during the study","atrial fibrillation,atrial remodeling,dysrhythmias,valsartan;","Cardiovascular Diseases;Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;",C0004238;C0003009;C0199176;C2825055;C0216784,C0004238;C0003009;C2911690;C0199176;C2825055;C0216784;C4554418;C0032042;C3810851;C1561557;C3266262;C0947630;C3897779,C0007222;C0027462;C0007222;C0578998;C0004238;C0004238;C0004238;C0004238;C0004238;C0009488;C0031809;C1458156;C1458156;C1516879;C0278329;C0087111;C0002598;C0216784;C0087111;C0018017;C0087111;C0216784;C0216784;C0087111;C0282423;C0237607;C0332149;C3245501;C0262512;C0262512;C0032042;C0032042;C0262512;C0032042;C0332148;C0025344;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0456909;C0947630;C0393040;C0947630;C1561542;C0947630;C0184661;C4699604;C4699604;C1550655;C2911690;C4067746;C4684631;C1706074;C0018792;C0018792;C0449416;C3272565;C0332155;C0701928;C3858632,C0018792,C0085096;C0155626;C0011860;C0340489;C0007222;C0010054;C0871470;C0600061;C0013230;C1301624;C0020517;C0018799;C0013778;C0009488;C0018801;C0023895;C0700589;C0018801;C0232201;C0020538;C0184661;C0277785;C0277785;C1301725;C1301725;C1301725;C1301725;C1301725;C0220825;C0087111;C0030163;C0087111;C0087111;C0032961;C0012634;C0087111;C0012359;C0018787;C0549206;C0442711;C0150312;C0262512;C0262512;C0262512;C0262512;C0543467;C0040128;C0021102;C0021102;C0018787;C0543467;C0441636;C0038454;C0741847;C0025663;C0006826;C0332148;C0947630;C0947630;C1561542;C0149721;C0870733;C0870733;C0231221;C0184661;C4699619;C0009797;C4684637;C4067746;C3272565;C2828358;C4300452;C4055646;C1561542;C1561542;C1561542;C1561542;C4331837;C1444662;C3272565;C4698129,C0004238;C0216784;C0018792;C0003811;C3849973,20080301,,,Completed,23586654;21926261;21835301;20435196;19369667,80,16.0,0.00436981850261,0.00617449629847,Male or female patients >=40 years of age;;;;;;;;;;Sinus rhythm;;;;;;;;;;At least two ECG documented episodes of symptomatic AF in the previous 6 months or             After a successful cardioversion for AF performed between 14 days and 48 hours before             randomization;;;;;;;;;;At least one of the following underlying cardiovascular diseases/comorbidities:;;;;;;;;;;heart failure/documented history of LV dysfunction (defined as an EF <40%);;;;;;;;;;history of hypertension >=6 months with/without LVH;;;;;;;;;;Type II diabetes mellitus;;;;;;;;;;documented history of stroke or peripheral vascular disease;;;;;;;;;;documented history of coronary artery disease;;;;;;;;;;lone atrial fibrillation with documented LA dilation (LA diameter >=45 mm for men                  and >=40 mm for women);;;;;;;;;;Written informed consent to participate in the study prior to any study procedures,"Need for a continuous treatment with ARBs for any clinical reasons;;;;;;;;;;Contraindications or known hypersensitivity to ARBs;;;;;;;;;;Persistent standing systolic blood pressure < 110 mmHg;;;;;;;;;;Recent (<6 weeks) acute myocardial infarction or bypass surgery, or percutaneous             coronary intervention;;;;;;;;;;Clinically significant valvular etiologies;;;;;;;;;;Thyroid dysfunction;;;;;;;;;;Indication for pacemaker or ICD implant or for an ablative treatment, recent (<6             months) PM or ICD implant, previous ablative treatment;;;;;;;;;;Planned cardiac surgery, expected to be performed within 3 months;;;;;;;;;;Serum creatinine level above 2.5 mg/dL;;;;;;;;;;Significant liver disease;;;;;;;;;;Pregnant or lactating women or women of childbearing potential who are not protected             from pregnancy by an accepted method of contraception;;;;;;;;;;Any condition that in the opinion of the investigator would jeopardize the evaluation             of efficacy or safety or be associated with poor adherence to the protocol;;;;;;;;;;Presence of any non-cardiac disease (e.g. cancer) that is likely to significantly             shorten life expectancy;;;;;;;;;;Treatment with any investigational agent within 1 month before randomization;;;;;;;;;;Currently decompensated heart failure"

However,      standard ablative approaches targeting the pulmonary veins (PVs) are associated with a      success rate as low as 40%. In a recent study, Kumagai et al. described a new approach of      catheter ablation of AF isolating the posterior left atrium including all PVs (called Box      Isolation). In Kumagai's study, 46 patients with symptomatic AF underwent box isolation. At 6      months follow up, 43 of 46 patients (93%) were arrhythmia free without antiarrhythmic drugs,      with a single procedure success rate of 87% (40/46). This study provided new evidence      supporting the hypothesis that the posterior wall is of high importance for the maintenance      of AF.

Developing this condition may cause      significant health problems and symptoms that affect normal day-to-day activities. Patients      with AF also have a shorter life expectancy on average. Tablets used to try to normalise the      heart rhythm rarely work well. As a result, doctors have devised a treatment to try to cure      this condition. Special wires (called catheters) are used to deliver heat energy (called      ablation) on the inside surface of the heart. This technique has been used more and more in      recent years for patients with troublesome symptoms due to AF.      The aim of the treatment is to draw lines of ablation in specific places in the heart.      Unfortunately, a lot of patients (almost 50%) get AF again after this treatment and most of      these patients have a second treatment performed. It is usually found at this second      treatment that gaps have developed in the lines of ablation that were drawn the first time      around. The investigators think that electively doing a second treatment to close these gaps      a couple of months after the first treatment may mean that fewer of these patients will get      AF again in the future. The investigators also want to find out what factors make a line of      ablation less likely to develop gaps.      In this study, participants will be assigned to one of two groups:        1. a ""standard care"" group, who will have a single treatment initially.        2. a ""repeat study"" group, who will have the initial treatment followed by a second           treatment 8-10 weeks later.      For patients in the ""repeat study group"", investigators will see how many have developed gaps      since their first treatment. The investigators will look at where these gaps are and will      compare this with information collected during the first treatment to try to work out why the      gap has developed. Any gaps found at the second treatment will be closed again.      All participants will then be monitored carefully over 12 months to see how many from each      group get AF again. To do this, all participants will be given a handheld heart rhythm      monitor to keep until the end of the study. This device is simple to use. Participants will      be asked to make a 30 second recording of their heart rhythm each day and also whenever they      have symptoms. These recordings will be downloaded at review appointments arranged 6 weeks, 3      months, 6 months and 12 months after the initial ablation procedure.",Atrial fibrillation;Pulmonary vein isolation;Pulmonary vein reconnection;,"Cardiovascular Diseases;Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;",C0004238;C2825055;C0547070,C0034090;C0220825;C0204727;C0679199;C1547582,C0004238;C0039231;C0012634;C0012634;C0087111;C0012634;C0085590;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0184661;C0547070;C0547070;C1552740;C0547070;C0547070;C1552601;C2828392;C0547070;C0308779;C0030695;C0871269;C0001721;C1553386;C0871269;C0424589;C0332148;C1552839;C0087136;C0871269;C0871269;C0282443;C0018787;C0018787;C0018787;C0018787;C0039869;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C3244317;C0018787;C0947630;C0018787;C1273517;C1273517;C1273517;C1561538;C1561538;C0042789;C0042789;C1561538;C4699604;C4699604;C0424818;C0033213;C1550655;C1457887;C1457887;C3242430;C0429001;C0723323;C2363670;C2363670;C2363670;C1561542;C1561542;C1561542;C1552839;C1552839;C1552839;C1552839;C0030695;C0701928;C2363670,C0004238,C0026268;C0003280;C0013798;C0489482;C0003281;C0034090;C0878544;C0013778;C0018827;C0204727;C0184661;C0032961;C0547070;C0043031;C0547070;C3245501;C0031843;C0018787;C0205082;C0205082;C1551994;C0235480;C3245501;C0180307;C4527217;C1704258;C4684637;C4697772;C4283785;C1995642;C4699190;C4699190;C0546816,C0018792;C0042449;C0042449,20160201,,,Completed,29759434,0,0.0,0.0057429154926940005,0.005888351563072,"Aged over 18 years;;;;;;;;;;Current pattern of paroxysmal AF (defined as electrocardiogram (ECG)-proven episodes             of AF which are self-limiting and last less than 7 days on each occasion, or which             were cardioverted electrically or pharmacologically less than 48 hours from onset);;;;;;;;;;Due to undergo pulmonary vein isolation by radiofrequency (RF) ablation",Inability or unwillingness to receive oral anticoagulation with warfarin or             alternative anticoagulant drug;;;;;;;;;;Previous ablation procedure for AF;;;;;;;;;;Unwillingness or inability to complete the required follow-up arrangements;;;;;;;;;;Current pattern of persistent (episodes of AF which last longer than 7 days or which             last longer than 48 hours but require electrical or pharmacological cardioversion) or             permanent AF;;;;;;;;;;Prior prosthetic mitral valve replacement or severe structural cardiac abnormality;;;;;;;;;;Reversible cause for AF;;;;;;;;;;Known infiltrative cardiomyopathy;;;;;;;;;;Known severe left ventricular systolic function (ejection fraction <35%);;;;;;;;;;Pregnancy

The presence of AF markedly increases the      patient's risk for developing arterial embolism and stroke, depending on the presence of      other clinical conditions, such as hypertension and diabetes. AF is associated with a      fivefold increased risk for stroke, and is estimated to cause 15% of all strokes.      Patients with AF frequently have several risk factors for atherosclerosis, including      hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. Accordingly, systemic signs of atherosclerosis can      be detected in AF patients, and these likely accounts for an enhanced risk of coronary heart      disease. In addition to cerebrovascular disease, patients with AF may suffer from coronary      events including myocardial infarction (MI), but the rate of MI in AF patients seems to be      variable, but often underestimated.      Moreover, coexistence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a relevant clinical sign of      systemic atherosclerosis.      Ankle-brachial index (ABI) is a simple, inexpensive, and non-invasive PAD measurement, even      at the pre-symptomatic phase when intervention can improve prognosis and prevent or delay      severe complications ABI is calculated by measuring the systolic blood pressure in the      posterior tibial and/or the dorsalis pedis arteries either in both legs or 1 leg chosen at      random (using a Doppler probe or alternative pulse sensor), with the lowest ankle pressure      then divided by the brachial systolic blood pressure. In addition to peripheral artery      disease, the ABI also is an indicator of generalized atherosclerosis because lower levels      have been associated with higher rates of concomitant coronary and cerebrovascular disease,      and with the presence of cardiovascular risk factors.      Two large studies in patients with AF document the existence of PAD in about 3-5% of      patients. It is possible, however, that such an incidence has been underestimated as only      symptomatic patients were considered as affected by PAD. As PAD is an important marker of      systemic atherosclerosis, its association with AF reinforces the concept that patients with      AF have systemic atherosclerosis that potentially account for coronary complications.      To date, a national registry of AF patients is not available to verify the real impact of      cardiovascular events in this clinical setting.",Atrial Fibrillation;ABI;PAD;Registry;Italian;,"Cardiovascular Diseases;Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;",C0004238;C0031809;C0034975;C0003086;C0600653;C0947630;C0224240,C0004238;C0031809;C0034975;C0003086;C0600653;C0947630;C0224240,C0085096;C0007820;C0871470;C0871470;C0007820;C0027051;C1320716;C3888326;C0004238;C0549124;C0489868;C0019993;C0004153;C0004153;C0004153;C0004153;C0004153;C0004153;C3887460;C0009566;C0009566;C0020538;C0035648;C0020538;C0242339;C0184661;C0035648;C0003811;C0004083;C0033325;C0021212;C0237607;C0392148;C0392148;C0011849;C0011849;C0442726;C0018787;C0018787;C0003842;C0460139;C0018787;C0392148;C1301746;C0332149;C0018787;C0034975;C0018787;C0038454;C0012634;C0554756;C0012634;C0947630;C0542559;C3245511;C0871269;C0038454;C0038454;C0332148;C0683278;C0205082;C0183210;C0005516;C0018787;C0182400;C0034107;C0003086;C1140621;C0182158;C0182158;C1140621;C0182158;C0182158;C0182158;C0425358;C0231221;C0231221;C0224463;C0012634;C4699158;C1550655;C0184511;C1704258;C0723323;C1512346;C0202165;C4084912;C0224240;C0729829;C1441792;C3272565;C3272565;C4553760;C3272565;C1334278;C3854058;C3272565;C4699193,C0852949;C0018792;C0085096,C0004238;C0020550;C0032961;C0012634;C1519316;C0006826;C0947630;C0947630;C0009797;C1555709;C3843322;C0546816,C0018792,20141201,,,Completed,25998039;25555267,9,4.5,0.004330744743117,0.005828531217548001,"Non-valvular atrial fibrillation (paroxysmal, persistent or permanent);;;;;;;;;;Genders Eligible for Study: Both;;;;;;;;;;Ages Eligible for Study 18 years and older;;;;;;;;;;Signed written informed consent",Valvular AF;;;;;;;;;;Cancer;;;;;;;;;;Disease with life expectancy less than 3 years;;;;;;;;;;Pregnancy;;;;;;;;;;Hyperthyroidism

Dyssynchrony typically stems from electrical delay leading to      mechanical delay between the septal and lateral walls. Right ventricular apical pacing might      be associated with long-term adverse effects on left ventricular function, and alternative      pacing sites such as high septal or RVOT has been suggested.

The latter means that at the end of the study permanent atrial      fibrillation is prevented in comparable percentage of patients (70%) in both treatment      strategies. However, this will be accomplished at the cost of a higher number of electrical      cardioversions (2-3) in the episodic treatment group compared to the continuous treatment      group.",,"Cardiovascular Diseases;Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;",C0004238;C0002598;C0199176;C0087111,C0004238;C0518214;C0009653;C0002598;C0199176;C0087111;C0947630;C3897779;C0220880,C0004238;C0013778;C0013778;C0232197;C0002598;C0002598;C0002598;C0679199;C0087111;C0087111;C0220880;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0018792;C1561542;C1561542;C0947630;C0009653;C4331837;C1552839;C1552839;C1444662;C1444662,C0004238,C4230512;C0024117;C0027051;C0013230;C0003195;C0004238;C0004238;C0004238;C0037052;C0057522;C0003281;C0002965;C0020550;C0020676;C0013778;C0018801;C0700589;C1301725;C0002598;C0002598;C0002598;C0002598;C0025320;C0220825;C0199230;C0087111;C0087111;C0810633;C0087111;C0024109;C0087111;C0012634;C0332149;C0549206;C0549206;C0150312;C0442711;C0150312;C0087111;C0262926;C0277556;C0018787;C0262926;C0012634;C0018787;C0543467;C0018787;C0543467;C0262926;C1551395;C0205054;C0012634;C0012634;C0441636;C0205082;C0032105;C0542560;C0025663;C0332148;C0456387;C1546725;C0013227;C0456387;C0022646;C1561543;C1273517;C2936173;C1561543;C0232219;C2707256;C0277556;C1550655;C1457887;C0009797;C0018827;C1444662;C1548428;C3883383;C2707259;C1561542;C1561542;C1561542;C0231221;C4699193;C0546816;C0546816;C0546816;C4698129,C1140111,20070301,,,Completed,20200016;18854540,9,4.5,0.0051237766862359995,0.005701062083896,"Symptomatic persistent atrial fibrillation for at least 48 hours- 1 year (present             episode).;;;;;;;;;;Older than 18 years of age.;;;;;;;;;;Ventricular rate during AF > 75 beats per minute, documented on rest-ECG without rate             control.;;;;;;;;;;At least two weeks of oral anticoagulation therapy before screening.;;;;;;;;;;Written informed consent.","Contra indications for amiodarone (severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or QTc             > 440ms).;;;;;;;;;;History of relapse of AF during adequate amiodarone treatment (i.e. adequate             amiodarone and desethylamiodarone plasma levels).;;;;;;;;;;Concomitant treatment with class I or III antiarrhythmic drugs.

Those clots can travel in the blood      circulation to the brain and cause a brain attack (""a stroke""). To prevent those clots      forming, blood thinners (anti-coagulants) are used. Apixaban is a blood thinner that works by      stopping one of the blood substances required for clotting (""Factor Xa""). It is approved and      used to prevent clots forming in people with ""AF"". Other established blood thinners work by      stopping clotting substances being made, known as ""Vitamin K antagonists"" or ""VKAs"". An      example of this type is Warfarin (Coumadin). The good effects of all blood thinners are      preventing clots, and they may also have bad effects of increasing the chance of bleeding.      People with ""AF"", abnormal heart beat, may benefit from changing it back to a normal regular      rhythm, known medically as ""cardioversion"". When this is done, people are currently most      commonly treated with a ""VKA"" blood thinner (e.g. warfarin). The purpose of this study is to      assess the good and bad effects (""efficacy"" and ""safety"") of apixaban compared with warfarin      in people with ""AF"" in whom an early cardioversion is planned.",apixaban;oral anticoagulant;non-valvular atrial fibrillation;cardioversion;,"Cardiovascular Diseases;Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;",C0004238;C0013778;C0087111;C1831808;C0205161;C1517001;C0871269;C0231683;C0871269;C0947630;C0005767;C0018787;C0018787;C0004600;C1550655,C0004238;C2917212;C4553491;C0013778;C1831808,C3653316;C1744601;C0004238;C1744601;C0848112;C0003280;C0013778;C0003280;C0013778;C0005775;C1831808;C0723457;C3245501;C1328723;C0723457;C1328723;C0043031;C0699129;C0019080;C0043031;C1831808;C0043031;C1555670;C1304680;C0038454;C1553386;C0871269;C0302148;C0018787;C0302148;C0005767;C0006104;C0006104;C0302148;C0005767;C0005767;C0302148;C1546725;C0005767;C0005767;C0302148;C0947630;C1273517;C1273517;C0004600;C0541990;C2826078;C0544691;C1518681;C1518681;C0221106;C2363670;C0700287;C0700287;C0332155;C4698437;C0075414;C0075414,C0004238,C0018825;C0004238;C0004238;C0004238;C0013798;C1301624;C0336548;C0003281;C0241028;C0026269;C0003281;C3245491;C3245491;C3245491;C3245491;C0004239;C0599880;C1120149;C1533734;C0459471;C0013778;C0700589;C0003280;C0013778;C0006147;C0700589;C0683954;C1555471;C0070166;C0040207;C1301725;C0589507;C0030547;C1999375;C0087111;C0087111;C1620287;C0087111;C0012634;C1301746;C1552601;C1831808;C0549206;C0442711;C0022423;C0600109;C3245509;C3245509;C0600109;C0004057;C0004057;C0947630;C1561610;C0025663;C0725694;C0205082;C0043240;C0566415;C0025663;C0205082;C1301584;C1705425;C0947630;C0947630;C1551040;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C1705425;C0184252;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C1551040;C1551040;C1299581;C1316572;C1114365;C1114365;C1114365;C4021768;C2945640;C0184661;C3864998;C0086960;C4084914;C1550655;C1555587;C3245501;C0009797;C1548428;C0040399;C3842337;C1697779;C1548762;C0562357;C0332534;C1512346;C1512346;C4331837;C0018792;C0018792;C1553756;C0021141;C3899561;C0600109;C2346845;C1550518;C0034770;C0034770;C0034770,C0018792;C0003280,20170208,880.0,218400.0,Completed,29659797,6,6.0,0.005592841505655,0.0055451550043210006,"Subjects with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (as documented by electrocardiogram             (ECG) at Visit 1) indicated for cardioversion and initiation of anticoagulation in             accordance with the approved local label.

This can be felt as palpitations, tiredness, shortness of breath and passing out, plus can      lead to stroke, damage to the heart muscle and a shorter life span. Study participants will      receive a common treatment for atrial fibrillation called radiofrequency ablation (RFA),      where small lesions or ""burns"" are made inside the heart to cut off the abnormal impulses      that cause AF.

Subjects will be      randomized (like drawing straws) to be treated with one of the three strategies to see if      there is a difference in how well atrial fibrillation is controlled after treatment.",Atrial Fibrillation;A-Fib;AF;Persistent;Permanent;Pulmonary Vein Isolation;Ablation;,"Cardiovascular Diseases;Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;",C0004238;C0547070;C0679199,C0004238;C0003811;C0547070;C0233324;C1550655;C0679199;C1564718,C0850292;C0004238;C0013404;C0004238;C0004238;C4553491;C0030252;C0679199;C0679199;C0087111;C0012634;C0015672;C0087111;C0087111;C0205161;C0547070;C0221198;C0013113;C3245511;C0038454;C0010957;C3245511;C3245511;C0947630;C0018787;C0018787;C0018787;C0947630;C0006434;C0018787;C0947630;C1442948;C0000925;C0042789;C0935616;C0085632;C2911690;C0332155;C0546816,C0004238,C0013778;C0184661;C0184661;C0032961;C0547070;C0547070;C0262512;C0947630;C1551994;C0152325;C0050451;C1561538;C0235480;C1550655;C1550655;C0009797;C3843322;C4684637;C0546816,C0018792;C0042449;C0232197,20111001,,,Completed,22139886,35,35.0,0.0056335187103080005,0.005250784554747,"All patients of age ΓëÍ 30 years, undergoing their first ablation procedure that meet             ACC / AHA defined criteria for persistent or permanent AF will be eligible to             participate in the study.

Atrial fibrillation is associated with      increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, with stroke being an especially important      and potentially devastating complication. Many studies have investigated the efficacy of      different drugs in converting atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm. There are numerous      randomized controlled trials that have tested the efficacy of agents against placebo and some      trials that directly compared the efficacy of two or more different drugs. The class III      antiarrhythmic drug Ibutilde is approved for the acute termination of atrial fibrillation and      atrial flutter of recent onset and has been shown to be superior to sotalol and equivalent to      flecainide in this indication. Recently, the relatively atrial selective antiarrhythmic agent      vernakalant has been approved by the European Commission for the rapid conversion of recent      onset AF to sinus rhythm in adults. The investigators hypothesize that the period of time      needed for cardioversion to sinus rhythm and the efficacy of cardioversion within 90 minutes      is different between vernakalant and ibutilide in patients with recent-onset atrial      fibrillation.",recent-onset;,"Cardiovascular Diseases;Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;",C0004238;C2001572;C0082966,C0004238;C2001572;C0082966,C0282440;C1301700;C0003195;C0004238;C0004238;C0004238;C0003195;C0004238;C0003811;C0004239;C0013778;C0013778;C0009566;C0232201;C0232201;C0232201;C0232197;C2001572;C2001572;C0016229;C0082966;C0947630;C0032042;C0037707;C3245511;C0001721;C0038454;C0392366;C0018792;C0025344;C0018792;C0013227;C0013227;C0456387;C0425358;C1148554;C4084912;C4055646;C1328018;C1714809;C0056170;C0151576,C0004238,C0042508;C0155626;C0007196;C0031048;C0542380;C0948089;C0948268;C0871470;C0004245;C0018824;C0041657;C0004238;C0037052;C0040479;C0587355;C0020517;C0002965;C0878544;C0018801;C0020564;C0020649;C0018827;C0429028;C0003811;C0018827;C0185125;C0002453;C1301725;C0201975;C0002453;C0013227;C1697779;C0012634;C0024109;C0012634;C0032821;C0032961;C1457887;C1547226;C0443343;C0039082;C0205161;C0013404;C0262926;C0262926;C1551395;C0205054;C0027769;C0087111;C1319793;C0205082;C0002962;C0542560;C0205082;C0022646;C0013227;C0947630;C1561542;C0947630;C0004600;C0013227;C0392366;C1114365;C0043202;C0039231;C2707256;C0424530;C1548428;C3842337;C0085297;C0242422,,20150501,,,Completed,28175295,1,1.0,0.005034834783652,0.005157314127583,Symptoms of atrial fibrillation since no longer than 48 hours;;;;;;;;;;Age 18 - 90 years,"Need for immediate electrical cardioversion due to hemodynamic instability             (hypotension: systolic blood pressure < 100 mmHg, dyspnea, loss of consciousness,             unstable angina);;;;;;;;;;Moderate to severe heart failure (NYHA III/IV) and patients with previously documented             left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ΓëÁ 35%;;;;;;;;;;History or signs of acute coronary syndromes (acute myocardial infarction, unstable             angina) within the last 30 days;;;;;;;;;;Resting ventricular rate < 80 beats per minute without pace maker back-up;;;;;;;;;;QT interval of > 440 milliseconds;;;;;;;;;;Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome;;;;;;;;;;History of Torsade de pointes arrhythmias or other polymorphic ventricular             tachycardias;;;;;;;;;;Signs of thyreotoxicosis;;;;;;;;;;Sick Sinus Syndrome or atrioventricular block greater than first degree;;;;;;;;;;Severe valvular heart disease, clinically meaningful hypertrophic obstructive             cardiomyopathy, restrictive cardiomyopathy, or constrictive pericarditis;;;;;;;;;;Serious disorders of the hepatic, renal (Creatinine > 2.5mg/dl), pulmonary,             gastrointestinal, hematologic or central nervous system and serious psychiatric             disorders;;;;;;;;;;Abnormal serum electrolytes despite adequate therapy (especially potassium <3.5 mmol/l             or > 5.5 mmol/l);;;;;;;;;;Intravenous use of other Class I or III antiarrythmic drugs within 4 hours of study             drug application;;;;;;;;;;Pregnancy (a ╬▓-HCG test will be performed in all female subjects apart from women > 50             years and with amenorrhea for at least 12 month (absence of other causes of             amenorrhoea);;;;;;;;;;Known hypersensitivity to study medication"

To improve accuracy of rhythm surveillance thus      gaining a more ""real-life"" scenario of post surgical ablation therapy cardiac rhythm a new      insertable cardiac rhythm monitor device (Reveal® XT 9525, Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, MN,      USA) with full observational continuous heart rhythm documentation is implanted.

Heart failure has become a major clinical and public      health problem with approximately 300,000 Canadians being affected. Atrial fibrillation is a      rhythm disorder in which the upper chambers of the heart (the atria) are paralyzed by      continuous electrical activity. Some of the continuous chaotic electrical activity in the      atria travels to the lower cavities of the heart (the ventricles) causing then to beat      irregularly and very rapidly. It is the most frequent cardiac arrhythmia, affecting 5% of      individuals 65 years and older and it is associated with an increased risk of stroke. Both      conditions (heart failure and atrial fibrillation) often co-exist in the same patient. Heart      failure promotes atrial fibrillation and atrial fibrillation aggravates heart failure. The      Atrial Fibrillation and Congestive Heart Failure (AF-CHF) trial is investigating whether      preservation of normal cardiac rhythm influences mortality and morbidity. The AF-CHF study      began in 2001 and 1,378 patients have been enrolled from 123 participating centres, in North      America, South America, Europe, and Israel. The results of this trial which are expected in      October 2007, will improve decision-making for the physician and will provide useful      information to healthcare organizations responsible for the care of heart failure patients.",,"Cardiovascular Diseases;Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;",C0018802;C0004238,C0018802;C0004238,C0018802;C0004238;C0004238;C0004238;C0004238;C0004238;C0003811;C0018801;C0018801;C0018801;C0018801;C0018801;C0033085;C1273518;C0018827;C0436331;C0086388;C0220880;C0039082;C0012634;C4684790;C0679006;C0033213;C0018787;C0566415;C1552597;C0871269;C0038454;C1553386;C0871269;C0018787;C0005767;C0018787;C0524422;C0524422;C0018787;C0018787;C0947630;C0182537;C0012634;C4699618;C4699158;C0935616;C0184511;C1555587;C3242430;C1555670;C1552679;C2707259;C0804815;C4055646;C1555709;C0018792;C0018792;C1444662;C1444662;C3272565;C3272565;C4049938;C4049938;C0011334,C0018787;C0232197,C0428772;C0042508;C0006684;C0018823;C0027051;C0027051;C0022661;C0001969;C0002971;C0023977;C0281945;C0040479;C0155679;C0034065;C0489482;C0013516;C0023976;C0019993;C0020550;C0026269;C0878544;C0003195;C0018821;C0003015;C0003015;C0013778;C0700589;C0085762;C0231221;C1611825;C1611825;C0039231;C0003811;C0541782;C1516879;C0002598;C0018810;C0087111;C0332218;C0012634;C0679199;C3245501;C0004245;C0547070;C0011946;C3858758;C0079595;C0087111;C0262926;C0262512;C0262512;C0150312;C0543467;C0012265;C0087111;C0262926;C0543467;C0025344;C0871269;C0205082;C0003483;C0542560;C0025663;C0006826;C0456387;C0456387;C0013227;C1561542;C1546725;C0013227;C0013227;C1561543;C3843766;C0001645;C0013798;C0013798;C4699604;C0180307;C3887460;C4082977;C4684637;C3842337;C3714738;C1261322;C0332534;C1561542;C1561542;C1561542;C1561542;C1561542;C1561542;C4331837;C4331837;C4331837;C4331837;C4264315;C0231221;C3842480;C0332148;C0750558;C0886384;C1553382,C1140111,20071001,,,Completed,22798522;19564557;18565859,237,79.0,0.006883507253520001,0.004984654350588,"Left ventricular ejection fraction </=35% as measured by nuclear imaging,             echocardiography, or cardiac angiography within 6 months preceding enrollment.

The diagnosis of AF after cerebral ischemia is difficult to establish even      during the treatment at specialised stroke units, as paroxysmal episodes may terminate      spontaneously before arrival at the hospital and do not always show early recurrence.      However, the diagnosis of AF is of particular clinical relevance since adaequate      anticoagulation is one of the most effective secondary preventive treatments in stroke. The      detection rate of AF after stroke increases progressively by extending the duration and      intensity of cardiac monitoring. For this purpose innovative medical devices and implantable      event recorders have been suggested. However, high socioeconomic expenses, malcompliance and      the invasiveness of some of these approaches currently limit their use to a minority of      affected patients, while the growing number of stroke survivors is lacking access to free and      simple screening tools.      For primary prevention, the measurement of the peripheral pulse (MPP) is currently the only      guideline-recommended screening method among individuals aged 65 years or older. In contrast,      MPP has never been applied in the setting of secondary stroke prevention, probably because      several factors were expected to interfere with this simple technique, including sensomotor      and neuropsychiologic handicaps of stroke patients 18. This study investigates feasibility      and validity of MPP in this cohort (pilot phase) and compares daily MPP for 6 months with      repeated holter-ECG in patients after ischemic stroke.",stroke;atrial fibrillation;secondary prevention of stroke;peripheral pulse measurement;,"Nervous System Diseases;Cardiovascular Diseases;Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;",C0004238;C0948008;C1511790;C0038454;C0034107;C0034107;C3843236,C0235480;C0948008;C0038454;C0034107;C0034107,C0004238;C0150496;C0033144;C0917798;C1277289;C0948008;C0003281;C0025080;C0948008;C1458156;C0087111;C0011900;C0332218;C0087111;C0011900;C0027627;C0182913;C0199230;C0282423;C0199230;C0027627;C0231172;C0332148;C0542559;C3245511;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0025663;C0038454;C0034107;C0947630;C3843802;C1553407;C0021102;C0723323;C0723323;C0202165;C1511790;C0332534;C0449900;C4055646;C1561542;C0015733;C3272565,C0232197,C0013516;C0004238;C0917798;C0150369;C0162340;C1301725;C0087111;C0262512;C1550655;C0600109;C0150312;C0016385;C1550655;C0038454;C0025663;C0038454;C0566415;C1547229;C0947630;C0023185;C0034107;C0034107;C1299581;C1551994;C1114365;C0184661;C0206077;C0011900;C0022885;C0202165;C4331837;C4283785;C3858758,C0199176;C0034107;C0202165,20151001,,,Unknown status,25804569,1,1.0,0.004041682973615,0.004891813841269,"Acute cerebral ischemia and treatment on our stroke unit;;;;;;;;;;No previous history of AF and no evidence of AF during complete diagnostic work up             (including at least ECG, telemetric monitoring, transthoracic echocardiography,             extracranial und transcranial dopplersonography, routine laboratory);;;;;;;;;;Patient and/ relatives understand study procedures and is willing and able to learn             the method of pulse measurements;;;;;;;;;;Min.

Exclusion Criteria:          -  Patients with chronic atrial fibrillation,The purpose of this study is to investigate whether fish oil supplements may reduce the      frequency and duration of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation episodes.      Atrial fibrillation is a heart condition which effects a large percentage of the population .      Atrial fibrillation is a condition frequently experienced by people who have had pacemakers      inserted .      Certain Pacemakers have sophisticated monitoring features that are able to recognise episodes      of atrial fibrillation.      Fish oil supplements may be of benefit to patients with heart problems.Recent evidence      suggests that fish oils may be beneficial to patients with rhythm disturbances.      By interrogating pacemakers this study will investigate the effect of fish oil supplements on      the frequency and duration of episodes of atrial fibrillation.,,"Cardiovascular Diseases;Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;",C0235480;C0004238;C0016157;C2347273;C0720099;C1550655,C1140111,C0235480;C0004238;C0004238;C0004238;C0004238;C0795691;C0810633;C0810633;C0150369;C0810633;C0012634;C0012634;C0016157;C0016157;C0016157;C0016157;C0871269;C1518681;C0947630;C0018787;C0947630;C1299581;C0237607;C1518681;C1864991;C2347273;C0332534;C0441587;C1947943;C1947943;C1947943,C0004238,C0694539;C0004238;C0848753;C1550655;C1550655,C1140111,20130101,,,Completed,23890856,3,3.0,0.00462049074406,0.004839404913109,Patients who have had at least 2 previous episodes of atrial fibrillation and an             implanted pacemaker.,Patients with chronic atrial fibrillation

End stage renal disease,"Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is often undetected because characteristics such as short      duration, episodic, and frequently asymptomatic nature make it challenging to diagnose at the      bedside, leading to suboptimal secondary prevention. It is not uncommon for paroxysmal atrial      fibrillation to be undetected in a single electrocardiogram (ECG) on admission. Conventional      24-hour Holter monitoring is often used to detect paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. However,      systematic review suggests Holter monitoring will identify atrial fibrillation in only an      additional 4.6% of patients, no better than detection rates observed in groups lacking      routine monitoring. On the other hand, for ischemic stroke patients with sinus rhythm at      baseline but paroxysmal atrial fibrillation still suspected, no recommendation beyond      repeated 12-lead ECGs is made in the United Kingdom guideline. Serial 12-lead ECG has been      used to detect possible paroxysmal atrial fibrillation among acute ischemic stroke patients      and found 15 new cases of atrial fibrillation in 133 acute ischemic stroke patients (11.3%)      without atrial fibrillation at baseline. The optimal investigation strategy, including      modality, duration of investigation, and patient subgroup remains undefined, not only for      efficacy in the detection of atrial fibrillation, but also cost-effectiveness in healthcare      systems.

Post-operative AF, which leads to significant morbidity and      a prolonged hospital stay, complicates 20% to 40% of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgical      procedures. While recent studies indicate that interruption of the      renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by either angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition      or AT1 receptor antagonism decreases the incidence of AF following a heart attack or      cardioversion (electric shock to the heart), its effect on the incidence of post-operative AF      has not been throughly studied. Studies in both animals and humans suggest that      inflammation-induced atrial remodeling plays an important role in the cause of AF. Recent      studies also provide evidence that activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system      induces inflammation, myocyte injury, proarrhythmic electrical remodeling, and fibrosis      through aldosterone.",atrial fibrillation;cardiac surgery;,"Cardiovascular Diseases;Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;",C0004238;C0021368;C0003018;C0002006;C0373719;C0030201,C0021368,C0007202;C0004238;C0237314;C0013781;C0013778;C0027051;C0021368;C0021368;C0003018;C0002006;C0003018;C0003018;C0002006;C0002006;C0021467;C0220880;C0016059;C0947630;C3540698;C0947630;C1518681;C0018792;C3263723;C0018787;C0600138;C1704326;C0184661;C3849973;C3849973;C1555587;C0001721;C0442797;C4084912;C0700651;C1550549;C0543467;C0030201;C0151872,C0232197,C0871470;C0010055;C0600061;C0740858;C0013230;C0020649;C2700378;C4264510;C0428289;C0232970;C0459471;C0018821;C0038280;C0700589;C0003015;C0442856;C0001314;C0009566;C0003015;C0006147;C0005779;C0020461;C0851101;C0002006;C0002994;C0013227;C0162340;C0087111;C0332218;C0087111;C0012634;C1961139;C0043031;C0031843;C0332149;C0004271;C0549206;C0600109;C0262926;C0087111;C0262926;C0087111;C0262926;C0022646;C0725694;C0042036;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C1561542;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C1561543;C0013227;C0589121;C0184661;C0235480;C3653430;C3653430;C1444662;C2328206;C4067746;C0332149;C4331837;C4331837;C1546398;C0543467;C0332149,C0543467;C0018792;C0232197,20100801,198.0,4005.0,Completed,25468655;22824930;22626819;18824641,64,16.0,0.0037999656295370004,0.0046940903708719995,"Undergoing elective valvular heart surgery, coronary artery bypass grafting;;;;;;;;;;If female, must be postmenopausal for at least 1 year, status-post surgical             sterilization, or if of childbearing potential, utilizing adequate birth control and             willing to undergo urine beta-hcg testing prior to drug treatment and throughout the             study","History of AF other than remote paroxysmal AF;;;;;;;;;;Ejection fraction less than 30%;;;;;;;;;;Evidence of coagulopathy (INR greater than 1.7 without warfarin therapy);;;;;;;;;;Emergency surgery;;;;;;;;;;History of ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema;;;;;;;;;;Low blood pressure (systolic blood pressure less than 100 mmHg and evidence of             hypoperfusion);;;;;;;;;;Hyperkalemia (potassium level greater than 5.0 milliequivalents (mEq)/L at study             entry);;;;;;;;;;Impaired kidney function (serum creatinine level greater than 1.6 mg/dl);;;;;;;;;;Any underlying or acute disease requiring regular medication that could possibly cause             complications or make implementation of the study or interpretation of the study             results difficult;;;;;;;;;;Inability to discontinue current ACE inhibitor, AT1 receptor antagonist, or             aldosterone receptor antagonist therapy;;;;;;;;;;History of alcohol or drug abuse;;;;;;;;;;Treatment with any investigational drug in the month prior to study entry;;;;;;;;;;Mental condition that makes it impossible to understand the nature, scope and possible             consequences of the study;;;;;;;;;;Inability to comply with the study procedures (e.g., uncooperative attitude, inability             to return for follow-up visits, and unlikelihood of completing the study);;;;;;;;;;Pregnant or breastfeeding"

Also, it is      known that as many as half of all patients with known AF may not be receiving appropriate      anticoagulation for their condition. New technologies are making it possible to improve AF      detection. Subjects in this study will be screened for AF using three simple methods: a      30-second pulse check, a hand-held single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) device and a blood      pressure monitor with built-in AF screening capabilities.

Atorvastatin is a drug      approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of high cholesterol but      is not approved for preventing abnormal heartbeats. In addition to lowering cholesterol, the      drug reduces inflammation. Inflammation seems to help cause atrial fibrillation, a certain      type of abnormal heartbeat. In animals, atorvastatin reduces the risk of this type of      abnormal beats, and preliminary data in humans supports an effect of atorvastatin and other      similar drugs that have the same action on reducing the risk of this type of abnormal beats.      We, the researchers at Emory University, would like to learn if this drug could prevent the      return of these abnormal heartbeats.",Reactive Oxgen Speers;Atrial Fibrillation;Oxidative Stress;Inflammation;,"Cardiovascular Diseases;Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;",C0004238;C0286651;C0199176;C0087111,C0004238;C0286651;C0199176;C0087111,C0004238;C1522133;C1533734;C0013778;C0286651;C0286651;C0021368;C0021368;C0286651;C0286651;C0087111;C0205161;C0205161;C0205161;C0205161;C0205161;C0205161;C3540698;C1518681;C0947630;C0013227;C0023185;C0392366;C0013227;C1299581;C0013227;C0013227;C0013227;C1552861;C3245479;C0870814;C0013227;C1820370;C0201950;C1716046;C0087130,C0232197,C0235480;C0027121;C0810516;C0948268;C0010054;C0086565;C0018824;C0438717;C0341439;C1744601;C0004238;C0004238;C1301624;C0281875;C0020517;C0003281;C0002965;C0020550;C0241028;C0005823;C0013778;C0175636;C0018801;C0085762;C0700589;C0022658;C0020538;C0286651;C0010592;C0004083;C0013227;C0003811;C1516879;C1516879;C0376636;C0011900;C0032961;C1514811;C0087111;C3272565;C0547070;C0392148;C2698970;C0016385;C0221423;C0087111;C0262512;C0028678;C4035626;C0205082;C0087136;C0360714;C1553386;C0205082;C0027996;C0018787;C0013227;C1442948;C1561543;C0740170;C0021102;C0021102;C0360714;C3842337;C3539125;C1320102;C3809765;C0543467;C1321866;C0022885;C0201975;C1515258;C1561542;C0018792;C0523744;C2702329;C0151576;C0673848;C1140618,,20091001,96.0,192.0,Terminated,20946227,15,15.0,0.0050588581471809994,0.004580249953047,> or = 18 years of age;;;;;;;;;;Clinical diagnosis-abnormal heart beat known as atrial fibrillation/flutter (ECG             documentation);;;;;;;;;;Able to swallow pill form of drug,"< 18 years of age;;;;;;;;;;enrollment in another ongoing trial;;;;;;;;;;paroxysmal atrial fibrillation;;;;;;;;;;hemodynamic instability;;;;;;;;;;atrial fibrillation ablation within 6 months of enrollment;;;;;;;;;;a contraindication for anticoagulation;;;;;;;;;;severe valvular heart disease;;;;;;;;;;presence of single lead implantable cardioverter defibrillator;;;;;;;;;;unstable angina;;;;;;;;;;New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class IV heart failure;;;;;;;;;;hyperthyroidism;;;;;;;;;;uncontrolled hypertension (blood pressure > 180/100 at rest) on medications;;;;;;;;;;an illness that would limit life expectancy to less than 1 year;;;;;;;;;;use of statins within the previous 30 days;;;;;;;;;;significant coronary artery disease or lipid abnormalities necessitating statin             therapy;;;;;;;;;;implanted devices for active management of arrhythmias by pacing or defibrillation;;;;;;;;;;lack of access to a telephone;;;;;;;;;;illicit drug use;;;;;;;;;;alcohol abuse;;;;;;;;;;hypersensitivity to atorvastatin by history;;;;;;;;;;pregnancy;;;;;;;;;;sexually active female subjects not on contraception or surgically sterilized;;;;;;;;;;nursing mothers;;;;;;;;;;chronic liver disease or abnormal liver function (elevated transaminases 1.5 times the             upper limit of normal [ULN] of laboratory reference range);;;;;;;;;;severe renal disease (creatinine > 200 mmol/L);;;;;;;;;;inflammatory muscle disease or creatine kinase (CK) > 3 times ULN;;;;;;;;;;concurrent treatment with cyclosporine, fibrates, or high-dose niacin"

During      Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery, LV diastolic dysfunction is a frequent      occurrence. Failure of the left ventricle to dilate normally causes an increase in LV filling      pressure. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common complication after cardiac surgery affecting      20-30% of patients undergoing coronary revascularization procedures. AF is associated with      significant morbidity and mortality and has been identified as a causative factor of      increased length of both hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) stay after CABG surgery,      resulting in increased resource utilization and medical care costs.The primary aim of this      study is to determine if patients with preoperative diastolic dysfunction are exposed to      higher risk of AF after coronary revascularization surgery.",Cardiac Surgery;Diastolic Dysfunction;Atrial Fibrillation;,"Cardiovascular Diseases;Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;",C0520863;C0004238;C0543467,C0520863;C0004238;C0543467;C0581603;C1550655;C0018787,C0877341;C0877341;C0010055;C0520863;C0520863;C0520863;C0004238;C0225897;C0085559;C0018799;C0009566;C0496675;C0018827;C1273518;C0018827;C0220880;C0442797;C0220880;C1961139;C0460139;C0150312;C0543467;C0018787;C0543467;C0543467;C0543467;C3245511;C0700124;C3245511;C0947630;C0184661;C3714738;C1550043;C3843761;C0015411;C0151576;C0151576;C4082977,C0012634;C0018792,C0004238;C0018821;C0543467;C0262512;C0543467;C1561610;C0018787;C1444657;C0086960;C1550655;C1550655;C1550655;C0009797;C1546398,C0018787;C0232197,20100301,,,Completed,25005721,4,4.0,0.005207013410242001,0.004388633760815,scheduled for elective CABG or OPCAB surgery;;;;;;;;;;signed informed consent,Patients with a history of previous heart surgery and/or undergoing valvular heart             surgery.;;;;;;;;;;Patients with preoperative atrial fibrillation.;;;;;;;;;;Patients in whom TEE is contraindicated.

In addition,      quality of life is diminished due to palpitations, dyspnea, dizziness and syncope. AF is      frequently associated with valvular and coronary disease. In the AF patients undergoing      valvular or coronary surgery the arrhythmia almost always relapses. For symptom control      anti-arrhythmic drugs and cardioversion are used but breakthrough arrhythmias and side      effects of the drugs happen frequently. For more effective symptom control ""add-on""      arrhythmia surgery is being advocated. However, at present the investigators do not know      whether add-on arrhythmia surgery indeed affects morbidity and quality of life.      The hypothesis being studied is that add-on arrhythmia surgery in patients with AF undergoing      valvular or coronary surgery improves quality of life, establishes chronic sinus rhythm and      reduces perioperative and long-term morbidity associated with AF.",Atrial fibrillation;Health related Quality of Life;Add-on surgery;Ablation;Randomised controlled trial;SF-36;EuroQoL;MFI-20;,"Cardiovascular Diseases;Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;",C0004238;C0518214;C0018821;C0003811;C0543467;C1550655,C0004238;C0518214;C1536078;C0003811;C0543467;C1554112;C1550655;C0233492;C1328956;C0882214;C0018787,C0004238;C0010068;C0518214;C1274136;C1274136;C0518214;C0518214;C0013778;C0030252;C0232201;C0003811;C0003811;C0003811;C0003811;C0003811;C0220880;C0012833;C0220880;C0220880;C0018787;C0018787;C0013404;C0039070;C0543467;C0543467;C0150312;C0543467;C0543467;C0543467;C0013227;C0013227;C1273517;C0003195;C3844113;C0277556;C1518681;C0001721;C0184511;C1880354;C0151576,C0004238,C0694539;C0037052;C0354604;C0232197;C1301725;C0018787;C0543467;C0543467;C0018792;C3244317;C0600116;C1301624;C1550655;C1550655;C1550655;C1550655;C1550655;C0009797;C0231189,C0018792;C0233492;C2911690;C0518214,20051101,,,Completed,19925605,4,4.0,0.004823910827986,0.004105455198283,"Patients undergo valvular surgery and/ or coronary surgery,;;;;;;;;;;All patients have documented chronic atrial fibrillation of paroxysmal atrial             fibrillation.;;;;;;;;;;Patients have given written informed consent.",Patients who do not speak Dutch or can not read Dutch.;;;;;;;;;;Patients with a Sick Sinus Syndrome.;;;;;;;;;;Patients with contraindications for oral anticoagulant agents.;;;;;;;;;;Incompetent to act for oneself

Catheter ablation is a minimally      invasive treatment that has been developed to help eliminate AF. It is a complex procedure to      perform so only a few hospitals are able to offer this treatment in the UK. A new technology      allows the operator to guide their catheters (thin wires) in the patient by using a      robotically steered sheath. This allows accurate and precise navigation that may improve the      accuracy and integrity of ablation. We aim to prove whether this technology can make AF      ablation easier and more effective.      Substudy: Platelet reactivity and activation in AF, and the impact of curative ablation.

In acute stage, guidelines recommend aspirin, but do not recommend      anticoagulation due to the increased risk of intracranial bleeding. Since, aspirin has a      limited efficacy of preventing recurrent stroke in AF, expert consensus suggests early      anticoagulation in non-severe stroke with AF. The current practice for acute ischemic stroke      patients with AF is delayed warfarin administration with aspirin use for non-minor stroke or      immediate warfarin administration (sometimes with heparin bridging) for minor stroke.      However, conventional anticoagulation with warfarin in acute ischemic stroke with AF has the      following limitations: 1) risk of intracranial bleeding particularly in acute stage, 2)      delayed action and transient paradoxical thrombogenic tendency due to the inhibition of      protein C, resulting in the risk of early recurrent embolic stroke, and 3) prolongation of      hospitalization waiting for full anticoagulation. In contrast, as compared to warfarin,      rivaroxaban is advantageous for reduced risk of intracranial bleeding and immediate      anticoagulation efficacy.      Goal The current trial will examine whether early initiation (within 5 days from stroke      onset) of rivaroxaban as compared to conventional warfarin would reduce intracranial      bleeding, recurrent embolic stroke, and hospital stay in patients with acute ischemic stroke      due to AF.",stroke;TIA;,"Nervous System Diseases;Cardiovascular Diseases;Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;",C0004238;C0948008;C1739768;C0043031;C1547229,C0151699;C0004238;C0948008;C0262469;C0751956;C1739768;C0043031;C3159309;C1547229,C0151699;C0151699;C0151699;C0004238;C0948008;C0003281;C0003281;C0948008;C0003281;C0948008;C0019993;C0003281;C0003281;C0948008;C1533734;C1533734;C0262469;C0262469;C0524466;C1739768;C1739768;C1458156;C0162791;C0021467;C0589507;C0332167;C1697779;C0033621;C1697779;C0237607;C0043031;C0043031;C0043031;C0043031;C0043031;C0019080;C0699809;C0004057;C0004057;C0004057;C0019134;C0038454;C0205082;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C1547229;C1300072;C1300072;C0018017;C4699158;C0000589;C1550450;C0449900;C0018792;C3834249;C0011202,C1550450,C0235480;C0032143;C0017181;C0228465;C0022661;C0228465;C0151699;C0004238;C0004238;C0586003;C0948807;C1458140;C4048276;C0040034;C0948008;C0741884;C0085605;C1510411;C1510411;C0225988;C0231221;C0332677;C0020538;C0815275;C0549099;C0162575;C0035124;C1301725;C1704788;C0021308;C0021308;C0021308;C0019080;C0021308;C1516879;C0030163;C0028778;C0868996;C0018944;C0043031;C0019080;C0019080;C0019080;C0021308;C1552616;C0021308;C0087111;C0262512;C0543467;C0221423;C0543467;C1550512;C0038454;C0871269;C0034869;C0205082;C0038454;C0087136;C0003842;C0718247;C0205082;C0002871;C0205082;C1547229;C1321564;C0007963;C0184252;C0598801;C0175209;C0030625;C1114365;C0017654;C0175209;C0030625;C1306620;C1305849;C0231221;C0933845;C0019080;C0948093;C3842337;C3842337;C0007762;C0007762;C0085297;C3272565;C3244072;C1561542;C1561542;C2707931;C2732140;C0019080;C0019080;C0056170;C0151576;C0151872,,20151201,216.0,4888.0,Completed,28892526;25346499,6,3.0,0.004166895609021,0.003741964414772,"Acute ischemic stroke or TIA presumed to be cardioembolic origin (within 5 days from             stroke onset) with mild severity: infarct size on DWI less than 1/3 of MCA territory,             1/2 of ACA territory, 1/2 of PCA territory, and 1/2 of one cerebellar hemisphere;;;;;;;;;;Atrial fibrillation including paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: atrial fibrillation must             be documented by ECG evidence (e.g., 12-lead ECG, rhythm strip, Holter, pacemaker             interrogation) within 30 days before randomization.

The investigators propose to implement an automated algorithm using      electronic medical record (EMR) data to alert physicians in a large primary care practice      network at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) of their patients with AF and elevated      stroke risk that are not taking an anticoagulant for stroke prevention. The investigators      hypothesize that interventions to notify physicians of such individuals may prompt      reassessment for the need for anticoagulation, and thereby increase guideline-indicated      anticoagulation rates. Additionally, in a survey component, physicians will characterize      reasons for not pursuing anticoagulation in AF patients at elevated risk for stroke.",,"Cardiovascular Diseases;Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;",C0004238;C2917212;C0804815;C0162791;C0422202;C0184511,C0004238;C2917212;C0804815;C0162791;C0422202;C0184511,C2362543;C0004238;C1277289;C0003281;C0003281;C0003281;C0003280;C0886296;C0033137;C1277291;C0002045;C0282423;C0237607;C3812897;C0038454;C0038951;C0038454;C0239110;C0018017;C3245479;C0184511;C0031809;C1524073;C0856882;C0856882;C0729829;C0007952,C0004238,C3814049;C0004238;C4699158;C0003280;C0033137;C0184661;C0237607;C0011900;C3812897;C3812897;C0038454;C0947630;C0011065;C3843777;C1550655;C1550043;C3843792;C1555709;C3534109;C4331837,C1140111,20170507,,,Completed,30076573,1,1.0,0.0038233177373140003,0.0031171378430500003,Adult patients 18 and older seen in Massachusetts General Hospital primary care             practices in the past 3 years;;;;;;;;;;Diagnosed with atrial fibrillation;;;;;;;;;;Increased risk of stroke (CHA2DS2VASc score ΓëÍ 2);;;;;;;;;;Not currently taking an anticoagulant,Patients who are subsequently identified as having died prior to or during the course             of the study intervention using the Social Security Death Index;;;;;;;;;;Listed in the Massachusetts General Hospital system as having a PCP outside of the             network
